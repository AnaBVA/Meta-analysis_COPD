GSE77344	Gene expression in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients	(Submitter supplied) Measuring genome-wide changes in transcript abundance in circulating peripheral whole blood cells is a useful way to study disease pathobiology and may help elucidate biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of disease. The sensitivity and interpretability of analyses carried out in this complex tissue, however, are significantly affected by its heterogeneity. It is therefore desirable to quantify this heterogeneity, either to account for it or to better model interactions that may be present between the abundance of certain transcripts, some cell types and some indication. more..

While increased cell turnover is expected in these cases, little is known about whether and how NK cell homeostatic balance and numbers are maintained by CD34+ progenitor cells.

Mechanisms for reduced DLCO in the setting of HIV infection are not well understood. We hypothesized that HIV-associated gas exchange impairment is indicative of system-wide perturbations that could be reflected by alterations in peripheral blood gene expression.  Methods: A total of 40 HIV-infected (HIV+) and uninfected (HIV-) men with preserved versus reduced DLCO were selected from a larger cohort study of lung function. more..

Samples for analyses were collected from a multicenter, three-period, three-way, placebo-controlled, double-blind, complete block crossover study. Eligible patients underwent three, 32-day treatment periods during which they received CHF6001 800 or 1600 µg twice daily (total daily doses of 1600 or 3200 µg) or matching placebo, all via multi-dose dry-powder inhaler (NEXThaler). more..
