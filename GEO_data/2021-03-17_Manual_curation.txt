GSE40885	Data expression in alveolar macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharide in humans	(Submitter supplied) Rationale: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is ubiquitous in the environment. Inhalation of LPS has been implicated in the pathogenesis and/or severity of several lung diseases, including pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma. Alveolar macrophages are the main resident leukocytes exposed to inhaled antigens.   Objectives: To obtain insight into which innate immune pathways become activated within human alveolar macrophages upon exposure to LPS in vivo	Homo sapiens	14	GPL570	CEL	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE40nnn/GSE40885/	ALVEOLAR_MACROPHAGES	COPD_ASTHMA	CONTROL	NA	14	NO	
GSE13896	Smoking-dependent Reprogramming of Alveolar Macrophage Polarization: Implication for Pathogenesis of COPD	(Submitter supplied) Background: When exposed to specific stimuli, macrophages exhibit distinct activation programs, M1 and M2 polarization, that define macrophage function as inflammatory/immune effectors or anti-inflammatory/tissue remodeling cells, respectively. Due to their position on the lung epithelial surface, alveolar macrophages (AM) directly interact with environmental stimuli such as cigarette smoke, the major risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). more..

GSE130928	Alveolar macrophage immunometabolism and lung function impairment in smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease	(Submitter supplied) Background: Metabolic plasticity involving shifts between mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis is emerging as a crucial component of efficient innate immune cell responses. Alveolar macrophages (AMs), the most abundant antigen-presenting cells in the lung, are dramatically increased in the lungs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, COPD AMs exhibit dysfunctional responses to infection with lower phagocytic ability and impairment of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. more..

GSE137557	Expression data from airway basal cells and mucociliary-differentiated epithelium of COPD patients and normal subjects	(Submitter supplied) Continuous stress caused by smoking induces changes in the cell population of small airway epithelium, with basal cell hyperplasia and goblet cell metaplasia at the expense of ciliated cells, and there is now compiling evidence that basal cells play a key role in the early pathogenesis of Chronic Obtructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). We hypothesized that COPD airway basal cells undergo transcriptomic changes during differentiation that are different from those observed in normal cells and can explain the formation of an abnormal epithelium. more..

Mechanisms for reduced DLCO in the setting of HIV infection are not well understood. We hypothesized that HIV-associated gas exchange impairment is indicative of system-wide perturbations that could be reflected by alterations in peripheral blood gene expression.

Based on reports that inherited copy number variations (CNV) in the genome modulate some GST expression levels and with the knowledge that cigarette smoke contains >3000 xenobiotics, and that the small airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages are involved early in the pathogensis of smoking-induced lung disease, we asked: do germline CNVs modulate GST expression level in the small airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages? Affymetrix HG U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays were used to survey GST gene expression in the small airway epithelium and alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoscopic brushings from current smokers (n=35) and nonsmokers (n=35). more..

HMGA1 expression suppresses the abnormal basal cell differentiation to squamous, inflammatory and epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype commonly observed in association with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results: HMGA1 knockdown experiments indicate that when HMGA1 expression is suppressed, the airway basal cells cannot normally differentiate into a mucociliary epithelium, form an intact barrier, and repair following injury. more..

Remodeling of the bronchial airways in COPD includes changes in both the bronchial epithelium and the subepithelial extracellular matrix (ECM).

Based on the underlying hypothesis that these airway epithelial changes must involve quantitative changes in genes involved with the regulation of differentiation, we assessed the expression of the Notch pathway, a signaling pathway known to play a fundamental role in the embryonic lung as a gatekeeper for differentiation, in the small airway epithelium of non-smokers, normal smokers, and smokers with COPD. more..

GSE7557	Human bronchial epithelial cells_Passage 3 vs. passage 0	(Submitter supplied) Squamous metaplasia is common in smokers and is associated with airway obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A major mechanism of airway obstruction in COPD is thickening of the small airway walls. We asked whether squamous metaplasia actively contributes to airway wall thickening through alteration of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions in COPD. Using immunohistochemical staining, airway morphometry and fibroblast culture of lung samples from COPD patients, genome-wide analysis of a model of squamous metaplasia, and in vitro modeling of human airway epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, we have produced evidence that squamous metaplasia, through the increased secretion of IL-1, induces a fibrotic response of adjacent airway fibroblasts. more..

GSE63073	Genes related to emphysema are enriched for ubiquitination pathways	(Submitter supplied) Increased small airway resistance and decreased lung elasticity contribute to the airflow limitation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  The lesion that corresponds to loss of lung elasticity is emphysema; the small airway obstruction is due to inflammatory narrowing and obliteration.  Despite their convergence in altered physiology, different mechanisms contribute to these processes. The relationships between gene expression and these specific phenotypes may be more revealing than comparison with lung function. We measured the ratio of alveolar surface area to lung volume (SA/V) in lung tissue from 43 smokers.  Two samples from 21 subjects, in which SA/V differed by > 49 cm2/mL were profiled to select genes whose expression correlated with SA/V.  The level of expression of 181 transcripts was related to SA/V ( p< 0.05).   The relationship between expression of these transcripts and SA/V was tested in the 22 remaining subjects as a replication.  Thirty of the 181 genes remained significantly associated with SA/V (P<0.05) and the direction of association was the same in 164/181. Pathway and network analysis revealed enrichment of genes involved in protein ubiquitination, and western blotting showed altered expression of genes involved in protein ubiquitination in obstructed individuals. These data implicate modified protein ubiquitination and degradation as a potentially important pathway in the pathogenesis of emphysema.

An imbalance between HAT and HDAC activities resulting in hyperacetylation of histones has been identified in COPD.  We hypothesized that BET inhibitor (JQ1) treatment of BET protein interactions with hyperacetylated sites in the chromatin will regulate excessive activation of pro-inflammatory genes and survival of key inflammatory drivers, alveolar macrophages (AM) in COPD. more..

Transcriptomic measurements were carried out using Affymetrix Human Gene 2.1 ST ArrayStrip in 17 samples: 8 asthma (4 ICS naive , 4 ICS treated), 4 COPD and 5 control samples. more..

GSE22148	Induced Sputum Genes Associated With Spirometroc and Radiological Disease Severity in COPD Ex-smokers	(Submitter supplied) Induced sputum is used to sample inflammatory cells, predominantly neutrophils and macrophages, from the airways of COPD patients. Our aim was to identify candidate genes associated with the degree of airflow obstruction and the extent of emphysema by expression profiling, and then to confirm these findings for selected candidates using specific PCR and protein analysis	Homo sapiens	143	GPL570	CEL	ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE22nnn/GSE22148/	SPUTUM	EMPHYSEMA_COPD	NA	143	NA	NO
