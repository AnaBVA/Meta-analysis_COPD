# Meta-analysis_COPD

## AIM: Meta-analysis of gene expression experiments on COPD patients

This repository was created to analyze a meta-analysis from COPD patients using public data and pre-processing (e.i. RMA).
All data was downloaded into the computer `10.200.0.42` (restricted access). The scripts were also run in that maching.

The `HTML`outputs can also be downloaded.

The Dashboard app needs some files that can be found in:
