We investigated SARS-CoV-2 potential tropism by surveying expression of viral
entry-associated genes in single-cell RNA-sequencing data from multiple tissues
from healthy human donors. We co-detected these transcripts in specific
respiratory, corneal and intestinal epithelial cells, potentially explaining the 
high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These genes are co-expressed in nasal
epithelial cells with genes involved in innate immunity, highlighting the cells' 
potential role in initial viral infection, spread and clearance. The study offers
a useful resource for further lines of inquiry with valuable clinical samples
from COVID-19 patients and we provide our data in a comprehensive, open and
user-friendly fashion at www.covid19cellatlas.org.

Cigarette smoke (CS) is the leading risk factor to develop COPD. Therefore, the
pathologic effects of whole CS on the differentiation of primary small airway
epithelial cells (SAEC) were investigated, using cells from three healthy donors 
and three COPD patients, cultured under ALI (air-liquid interface) conditions.
The analysis of the epithelial physiology demonstrated that CS impaired barrier
formation and reduced cilia beat activity. Although, COPD-derived ALI cultures
preserved some features known from COPD patients, CS-induced effects were
similarly pronounced in ALI cultures from patients compared to healthy controls. 
RNA sequencing analyses revealed the deregulation of marker genes for basal and
secretory cells upon CS exposure. The comparison between gene signatures obtained
from the in vitro model (CS vs. air) with a published data set from human
epithelial brushes (smoker vs. non-smoker) revealed a high degree of similarity
between deregulated genes and pathways induced by CS. Taken together, whole
cigarette smoke alters the differentiation of small airway basal cells in vitro. 
The established model showed a good translatability to the situation in vivo.
Thus, the model can help to identify and test novel therapeutic approaches to
restore the impaired epithelial repair mechanisms in COPD, which is still a high 
medical need.

Diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia injure the gas-exchanging alveoli of the 
human lung. Animal studies have indicated that dysregulation of alveolar cells,
including alveolar type II stem/progenitor cells, is implicated in disease
pathogenesis. Due to mouse-human differences, there has been a desperate need to 
develop human-relevant lung models that can more closely recapitulate the human
lung during homeostasis, injury repair, and disease. Here we discuss how current 
single-cell RNA sequencing studies have increased knowledge of the cellular and
molecular composition of human lung alveoli, including the identification of
molecular heterogeneity, cellular diversity, and previously unknown cell types,
some of which arise specifically during disease. For functional analysis of
alveolar cells, in vitro human alveolar organoids established from human
pluripotent stem cells, embryonic progenitors, and adult tissue from both healthy
and diseased lungs have modeled aspects of the cellular and molecular features of
alveolar epithelium. Drawbacks of such systems are highlighted, along with
possible solutions. Organoid-on-a-chip and ex vivo systems including
precision-cut lung slices can complement organoid studies by providing further
cellular and structural complexity of lung tissues, and have been shown to be
invaluable models of human lung disease, while the production of acellular and
synthetic scaffolds hold promise in lung transplant efforts. Further improvements
to such systems will increase understanding of the underlying biology of human
alveolar stem/progenitor cells, and could lead to future therapeutic or
pharmacological intervention in patients suffering from end-stage lung diseases.

RATIONALE: Emerging evidence supports a crucial role for tertiary lymphoid organs
(TLOs) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) progression. However,
mechanisms of immune cell activation leading to TLO in COPD remain to be defined.
OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of lung dendritic cells (DC) in T follicular
helper (Tfh)-cell induction, a T-cell subset critically implicated in lymphoid
organ formation, in COPD.
METHODS: Myeloid cell heterogeneity and phenotype was studied in an unbiased
manner via single-cell RNA sequencing on HLA-DR+ cells sorted from human lungs.
The in vitro capability of FACS-sorted DC-subsets of control and COPD lungs to
polarize IL-21+CXCL13+ Tfh-like cells was measured. In situ imaging analysis was 
performed on COPD stage IV GOLD lungs with TLO.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: ScRNAseq analysis revealed a high level of
heterogeneity among human lung myeloid cells. Among these, cDC2 showed increased 
induction of IL-21+CXCL13+ Tfh-like cells. Importantly, the capacity to induce
IL-21+ Tfh-like cells was higher in cDC2s from COPD patients compared with
control patients. Increased Tfh-induction by COPD cDC2 correlated with increased 
presence of Tfh-like cells in COPD lungs as compared to controls, and cDC2
co-localized with Tfh-like cells in TLOs of COPD. Mechanistically, cDC2 exhibited
a unique migratory signature and (transcriptional) expression of several pathways
and genes related to DC-induced Tfh-priming. Importantly, blocking the
co-stimulatory OX40L-OX40 axis reduced Tfh-induction by control lung cDC2.
CONCLUSIONS: In COPD lung, we found lung EBI2+ OX-40L-expressing cDC2 that
induces IL-21+ Tfh-like cells, suggesting an involvement of these cells in TLO
formation.

Targeting IL-17A/glucocorticoid synergy to CSF3 expression in neutrophilic airway
diseases.

Ouyang S, Liu C, Xiao J, Chen X, Lui AC, Li X.

IL-17A plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of steroid-resistant
neutrophilic airway inflammation, which is a hallmark of severe asthma and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Through RNA sequencing analysis of 
transcriptomes of human airway smooth muscle cells treated with IL-17A,
dexamethasone (DEX, a synthetic glucocorticoid drug), alone or in combination, we
identified a group of genes that are synergistically induced by IL-17A and DEX,
including the neutrophil-promoting cytokine CSF3. In type-17 (Th17/IL-17Ahi)
preclinical models of neutrophilic severe asthma (acute and chronic) and COPD,
although DEX treatment was able to reduce the expression of neutrophil-mobilizing
CXCL1 and CXCL2 in lung tissue, CSF3 expression was upregulated by DEX treatment.
We found that DEX treatment alone failed to alleviate neutrophilic airway
inflammation and pathology, and even exacerbated the disease phenotype when CSF3 
was highly induced. Disruption of the IL-17A/DEX synergy by IL-17A inhibition
with anti-IL-17A mAb or cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G, a small-molecule IL-17A
blocker) or depletion of CSF3 effectively rendered DEX sensitivity in type-17
preclinical models of neutrophilic airway diseases. Our study elucidates what we 
believe is a novel mechanism of steroid resistance in type-17 neutrophilic airway
inflammation and offers an effective steroid-sparing therapeutic strategy
(combined low-dose DEX and C3G) for treating neutrophilic airway diseases.

Our integrative genomic and functional analysis identified transforming acidic
coiled-coil-containing protein 2 (TACC2) as a chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) candidate gene. Here, we found that smokers with COPD exhibit a
marked decrease in lung TACC2 protein levels relative to smokers without COPD.
Single cell RNA sequencing reveals that TACC2 is expressed primarily in lung
epithelial cells in normal human lungs. Furthermore, suppression of TACC2
expression impairs the efficiency of homologous recombination repair and augments
spontaneous and cigarette smoke extract-induced (CSE-induced) DNA damage and
cytotoxicity in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells. By contrast,
enforced expression of TACC2 attenuates the CSE effects. We also found that CSE
enhances TACC2 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system mediated by the
ubiquitin E3 ligase subunit, F box L7. Furthermore, cellularly expressed TACC2
proteins harboring naturally occurring mutations exhibited altered protein
lifespan coupled with modified DNA damage repair and cytotoxic responses. CS
triggers emphysematous changes accompanied by accumulated DNA damage, apoptosis
of alveolar epithelia, and lung inflammation in Tacc2-/- compared with Tacc2+/+
mice. Our results suggest that CS destabilizes TACC2 protein in lung epithelia by
the ubiquitin proteasome system, leading to subsequent DNA damage, cytotoxicity, 
and emphysema.

Chronic hypoxia from diseases in the lung, such as pulmonary hypertension,
pulmonary fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can increase
pulmonary vascular resistance, resulting in hypertrophy and dysfunction of the
right ventricle (RV). In order to obtain insight into RV biology and perhaps
uncover potentially novel therapeutic approaches for RV dysfunction, we performed
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of RV and LV tissue from rats in normal ambient
conditions or subjected to hypoxia (10% O2 ) for 2 weeks. Gene ontology and
pathway analysis of the RV and LV revealed multiple transcriptomic differences,
in particular increased expression in the RV of genes related to immune function 
in both normoxia and hypoxia. Immune cell profiling by flow cytometry of cardiac 
digests revealed that in both conditions, the RV had a larger percentage than the
LV of double-positive CD45+ /CD11b/c+ cells (which are predominantly macrophages 
and dendritic cells). Analysis of gene expression changes under hypoxic
conditions identified multiple pathways that may contribute to hypoxia-induced
changes in the RV, including increased expression of genes related to cell
mitosis/proliferation and decreased expression of genes related to metabolic
processes. Together, the findings indicate that the RV differs from the LV with
respect to content of immune cells and expression of certain genes, thus
suggesting the two ventricles differ in aspects of pathophysiology and in
potential therapeutic targets for RV dysfunction.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic signatures in the nasal epithelium, which is a primary
interface with the environment and an accessible proxy for the bronchial
epithelium, might provide insights into mechanisms of allergic disease.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify and interpret methylation signatures in nasal
epithelial brushes associated with rhinitis and asthma.
METHODS: Nasal epithelial brushes were obtained from 455 children at the 16-year 
follow-up of the Dutch Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy birth 
cohort study. Epigenome-wide association studies were performed on children with 
asthma, rhinitis, and asthma and/or rhinitis (AsRh) by using logistic regression,
and the top results were replicated in 2 independent cohorts of African American 
and Puerto Rican children. Significant CpG sites were related to environmental
exposures (pets, active and passive smoking, and molds) during secondary school
and were correlated with gene expression by RNA-sequencing (n = 244).
RESULTS: The epigenome-wide association studies identified CpG sites
significantly associated with rhinitis (n = 81) and AsRh (n = 75), but not with
asthma. We significantly replicated 62 of 81 CpG sites with rhinitis and 60 of 75
with AsRh, as well as 1 CpG site with asthma. Methylation of cg03565274 was
negatively associated with AsRh and positively associated with exposure to pets
during secondary school. DNA methylation signals associated with AsRh were mainly
driven by specific IgE-positive subjects. DNA methylation related to gene
transcripts that were enriched for immune pathways and expressed in immune and
epithelial cells. Nasal CpG sites performed well in predicting AsRh.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified replicable DNA methylation profiles of asthma and
rhinitis in nasal brushes. Exposure to pets may affect nasal epithelial
methylation in relation to asthma and rhinitis.

Translation of genomic alterations to protein changes in chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) is largely unexplored. Using integrated proteomic and
RNA sequencing analysis of COPD and control lung tissues, we identified a protein
signature in COPD characterised by extracellular matrix changes and a potential
regulatory role for SUMO2. Furthermore, we identified 61 differentially expressed
novel, non-reference, peptides in COPD compared with control lungs. This included
two peptides encoding for a new splice variant of SORBS1, of which the transcript
usage was higher in COPD compared with control lungs. These explorative findings 
and integrative proteogenomic approach open new avenues to further unravel the
pathology of COPD.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common respiratory disease
characterized by irreversible airflow limitation. The current medications show
limited effects on the decline of pulmonary function in COPD. Our multicenter
clinical trial found that Bu-Shen-Fang-Chuan fomula (BSFCF), a Chinese herbal
formula, markedly reduced the frequencies of acute exacerbation of COPD and
delayed lung function decline. However, the underlying mechanisms are still
unclear. In this study, we established a COPD rat model through a 6-month
exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) and found that BSFCF (7.2 g/kg) effectively
improved CS-induced reduction in pulmonary function and remarkably decreased the 
numbers of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).
Importantly, BSFCF treatment notably prevented the accumulation of T-lymphocytes 
(especially CD8+ T-cells) in the lung of COPD rats. RNA sequencing analysis of
lung tissue demonstrated that CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11-CXCR3 chemokine axis in the
lung of CS-exposed rats was significantly suppressed by BSFCF. Moreover, our
Real-time PCR data verified that BSFCF evidently inhibited the mRNA expressions
of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCR3. Conclusively, BSFCF markedly improved
pulmonary function and attenuated CD8+ T-cells recruitment in the lung of
CS-exposed rats, which were partially through inhibition of
CXCL9/CXCL10/CXCL11-CXCR3 axis.

Rationale: The role of FSTL-1 (follistatin-like 1) in lung homeostasis is
unknown.Objectives: We aimed to define the impact of FSTL-1 attenuation on lung
structure and function and to identify FSTL-1-regulated transcriptional pathways 
in the lung. Further, we aimed to analyze the association of FSTL-1 SNPs with
lung disease.Methods: FSTL-1 hypomorphic (FSTL-1 Hypo) mice underwent lung
morphometry, pulmonary function testing, and micro-computed tomography. Fstl1
expression was determined in wild-type lung cell populations from three
independent research groups. RNA sequencing of wild-type and FSTL-1 Hypo mice
identified FSTL-1-regulated gene expression, followed by validation and
mechanistic in vitro examination. FSTL1 SNP analysis was performed in the
COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)
cohort.Measurements and Main Results: FSTL-1 Hypo mice developed spontaneous
emphysema, independent of smoke exposure. Fstl1 is highly expressed in the lung
by mesenchymal and endothelial cells but not immune cells. RNA sequencing of
whole lung identified 33 FSTL-1-regulated genes, including Nr4a1, an orphan
nuclear hormone receptor that negatively regulates NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB)
signaling. In vitro, recombinant FSTL-1 treatment of macrophages attenuated NF-κB
p65 phosphorylation in an Nr4a1-dependent manner. Within the COPDGene cohort,
several SNPs in the FSTL1 region corresponded to chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and lung function.Conclusions: This work identifies a novel role for
FSTL-1 protecting against emphysema development independent of smoke exposure.
This FSTL-1-deficient emphysema implicates regulation of immune tolerance in lung
macrophages through Nr4a1. Further study of the mechanisms involving FSTL-1 in
lung homeostasis, immune regulation, and NF-κB signaling may provide additional
insight into the pathophysiology of emphysema and inflammatory lung diseases.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent respiratory
disease characterized by airflow limitation and chronic inflammation. MiR-155 is 
described as an ancient regulator of the immune system. Our objective was to
establish a role for miR-155 in cigarette smoke (CS)-induced inflammation and
COPD. We demonstrate increased miR-155 expression by RT-qPCR in lung tissue of
smokers without airflow limitation and patients with COPD compared to never
smokers and in lung tissue and alveolar macrophages of CS-exposed mice compared
to air-exposed mice. In addition, we exposed wild type and miR-155 deficient mice
to CS and show an attenuated inflammatory profile in the latter. Alveolar
macrophages were sorted by FACS from the different experimental groups and their 
gene expression profile was analyzed by RNA sequencing. This analysis revealed
increased expression of miR-155 targets and an attenuation of the CS-induced
increase in inflammation-related genes in miR-155 deficient mice. Moreover,
intranasal instillation of a specific miR-155 inhibitor attenuated the CS-induced
pulmonary inflammation in mice. Finally, elastase-induced emphysema and lung
functional changes were significantly attenuated in miR-155 deficient mice. In
conclusion, we highlight a role for miR-155 in CS-induced inflammation and the
pathogenesis of COPD, implicating miR-155 as a new therapeutic target in COPD.

COPD is associated with disturbed tissue repair, possibly due to TGF-β-regulated 
miRNA changes in fibroblasts. Our aim was to identify TGF-β-regulated miRNAs and 
their differential regulation and expression in COPD compared to control
fibroblasts. Small RNA sequencing was performed on TGF-β-stimulated and
unstimulated lung fibroblasts from 15 COPD patients and 15 controls. Linear
regression was used to identify TGF-β-regulated and COPD-associated miRNAs.
Interaction analysis was performed to compare miRNAs that responded differently
to TGF-β in COPD and control. Re-analysis of previously generated Ago2-IP data
and Enrichr were used to identify presence and function of potential target genes
in the miRNA-targetome of lung fibroblasts. In total, 46 TGF-β-regulated miRNAs
were identified in COPD and 86 in control fibroblasts (FDR < 0.05). MiR-27a-5p
was the most significantly upregulated miRNA. MiR-148b-3p, miR-589-5p and
miR-376b-3p responded differently to TGF-β in COPD compared to control
(FDR < 0.25). MiR-660-5p was significantly upregulated in COPD compared to
control (FDR < 0.05). Several predicted targets of miR-27a-5p, miR-148b-3p and
miR-660-5p were present in the miRNA-targetome, and were mainly involved in the
regulation of gene transcription. In conclusion, altered TGF-β-induced miRNA
regulation and differential expression of miR-660-5p in COPD fibroblasts, may
represent one of the mechanisms underlying aberrant tissue repair and remodelling
in COPD.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a vital role in normal lung physiology to
maintain homeostasis in the airways via intercellular communication. EVs include 
exosomes and microvesicles, and are characterized by their phospholipid bilayers.
EVs have been recognized as novel circulating biomarkers of disease, which are
released by different cell types. In this study, we used different EV isolation
and purification methods to characterize the plasma-derived EV miRNAs from
non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD. A small RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
approach was adapted to identify novel circulating EV miRNAs. We found that
plasma-derived EVs from non-smokers, smokers and patients with COPD vary in their
size, concentration, distribution and phenotypic characteristics as confirmed by 
nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and immunoblot 
analysis of EV surface markers. RNA-seq analysis confirmed the most abundant
types of small RNAs, such as miRNAs, tRNAs, piRNAs snRNAs, snoRNAs and other
biotypes in plasma-derived EVs. We mainly focused on miRNAs as novel biomarkers
in smokers and patients with COPD for further analysis. Differential expression
by DESeq2 identified distinct miRNA profiles (up-regulated: miR-22-3p,
miR-99a-5p, miR-151a-5p, miR-320b, miR-320d; and down-regulated: miR-335-5p,
miR-628-3p, miR-887-5p and miR-937-3p) in COPD versus smokers or non-smokers in a
pairwise comparison. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of differentially
expressed miRNAs revealed the top pathways, gene ontology and diseases associated
with smokers and patients with COPD. We selectively validated miRNAs in EVs
isolated from BEAS-2B cells treated with cigarette smoke extract by quantitative 
PCR analysis. For the first time, we report that plasma-derived EV miRNAs are
novel circulating pulmonary disease biomarkers. Thus, molecular profiling of EV
miRNAs has great translational potential for the development of biomarkers that
may be used in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics of COPD.

The lung plays a vital role in maintaining homeostasis, as it is responsible for 
the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonary homeostasis is maintained by
a network of tissue-resident cells, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells
and leukocytes. Myeloid cells of the innate immune system and epithelial cells
form a critical barrier in the lung. Recently developed unbiased next generation 
sequencing (NGS) has revealed cell heterogeneity in the lung with respect to
physiology and pathology and has reshaped our knowledge. New phenotypes and
distinct gene signatures have been identified, and these new findings enhance the
diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases. Here, we present a review of the new
NGS findings on myeloid cells in lung development, homeostasis, and lung
diseases, including acute lung injury (ALI), lung fibrosis, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer.

Cigarette smoking causes lung inflammation and tissue damage. Lung fibroblasts
play a major role in tissue repair. Previous studies have reported
smoking-associated changes in fibroblast responses and methylation patterns. Our 
aim was to identify the effect of current smoking on miRNA expression in primary 
lung fibroblasts. Small RNA sequencing was performed on lung fibroblasts from
nine current and six ex-smokers with normal lung function. MiR-335-5p and
miR-335-3p were significantly downregulated in lung fibroblasts from current
compared to ex-smokers (false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05). Differential
miR-335-5p expression was validated with RT-qPCR (p-value = 0.01). The results
were validated in lung tissue from current and ex-smokers and in bronchial
biopsies from non-diseased smokers and never-smokers (p-value <0.05). The
methylation pattern of the miR-335 host gene, determined by methylation-specific 
qPCR, did not differ between current and ex-smokers. To obtain insights into the 
genes regulated by miR-335-5p in fibroblasts, we overlapped all proven miR-335-5p
targets with our previously published miRNA targetome data in lung fibroblasts.
This revealed Rb1, CARF, and SGK3 as likely targets of miR-335-5p in lung
fibroblasts. Our study indicates that miR-335-5p downregulation due to current
smoking may affect its function in lung fibroblasts by targeting Rb1, CARF and
SGK3.

BACKGROUND: Whether the clinical or pathophysiologic significance of the
"treatable trait" high blood eosinophil count in COPD is the same as for asthma
remains controversial. We sought to determine the relationship between the blood 
eosinophil count, clinical characteristics and gene expression from bronchial
brushings in COPD and asthma.
METHODS: Subjects were recruited into a COPD (emphysema versus airway disease
[EvA]) or asthma cohort (Unbiased BIOmarkers in PREDiction of respiratory disease
outcomes, U-BIOPRED). We determined gene expression using RNAseq in EvA (n = 283)
and Affymetrix microarrays in U-BIOPRED (n = 85). We ran linear regression
analysis of the bronchial brushings transcriptional signal versus blood
eosinophil counts as well as differential expression using a blood
eosinophil > 200 cells/μL as a cut-off. The false discovery rate was controlled
at 1% (with continuous values) and 5% (with dichotomized values).
RESULTS: There were no differences in age, gender, lung function, exercise
capacity and quantitative computed tomography between eosinophilic versus
noneosinophilic COPD cases. Total serum IgE was increased in eosinophilic asthma 
and COPD. In EvA, there were 12 genes with a statistically significant positive
association with the linear blood eosinophil count, whereas in U-BIOPRED, 1197
genes showed significant associations (266 positive and 931 negative). The
transcriptome showed little overlap between genes and pathways associated with
blood eosinophil counts in asthma versus COPD. Only CST1 was common to
eosinophilic asthma and COPD and was replicated in independent cohorts.
CONCLUSION: Despite shared "treatable traits" between asthma and COPD, the
molecular mechanisms underlying these clinical entities are predominately
different.

The inappropriate retention of neutrophils at inflammatory sites is a major
driver of the excessive tissue damage characteristic of respiratory inflammatory 
diseases including COPD, ARDS, and cystic fibrosis. The molecular programmes
which orchestrate neutrophil recruitment to inflammatory sites through
chemotactic guidance have been well-studied. However, how neutrophil sensitivity 
to these cues is modulated during inflammation resolution is not understood. The 
identification of neutrophil reverse migration as a mechanism of inflammation
resolution and the ability to modulate this therapeutically has identified a new 
target to treat inflammatory disease. Here we investigate the role of the
CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling axis in modulating neutrophil retention at inflammatory
sites. We used an in vivo tissue injury model to study neutrophilic inflammation 
using transgenic zebrafish larvae. Expression of cxcl12a and cxcr4b during the
tissue damage response was assessed using in situ hybridization and analysis of
RNA sequencing data. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to knockdown cxcl12a and cxcr4b in
zebrafish larvae. The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 was used to block the Cxcl12/Cxcr4
signaling axis pharmacologically. We identified that cxcr4b and cxcl12a are
expressed at the wound site in zebrafish larvae during the inflammatory response.
Following tail-fin transection, removal of neutrophils from inflammatory sites is
significantly increased in cxcr4b and cxcl12a CRISPR knockdown larvae.
Pharmacological inhibition of the Cxcl12/Cxcr4 signaling axis accelerated
resolution of the neutrophil component of inflammation, an effect caused by an
increase in neutrophil reverse migration. The findings of this study suggest that
CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling may play an important role in neutrophil retention at
inflammatory sites, identifying a potential new target for the therapeutic
removal of neutrophils from the lung in chronic inflammatory disease.

Evidences have shown a strong link between particulate matter (PM) and increased 
risk in human mortality and morbidity, including asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), respiratory infection, and lung cancer. However, the
underlying toxicologic mechanisms remain largely unknown. Utilizing PM-treated
human pulmonary fibroblasts (HPF) models, we analyzed gene expression microarray 
data and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to identify that the transcription
factor sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was the main
downstream regulator of Sirtuin1 (SIRT1). Quantitative PCR and western blot
results showed that SIRT1 inhibited SREBP1 and further downregulated Pirin (PIR) 
and Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome after PM exposure.
Inhibitors of SIRT1, SREBP1, and PIR could reverse PM-induced inflammation. An in
silico analysis revealed that PIR correlated with smoke exposure and early COPD. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays from PM-fed mouse models was
used to determine the association of PIR with PM. These data demonstrate that the
SIRT1-SREBP1-PIR/ NLRP3 inflammasome axis may be associated with PM-induced
adverse health issues. SIRT1 functions as a protector from PM exposure, whereas
PIR acts as a predictor of PM-induced pulmonary disease. The SIRT1-SREBP1-PIR/
NLRP3 inflammasome axis may present several potential therapeutic targets for
PM-related adverse health events.

While many disease-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are
associated with gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTLs), a
large proportion of complex disease genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants
are of unknown function. Some of these SNPs may contribute to disease by
regulating gene splicing. Here, we investigate whether SNPs that are associated
with alternative splicing (splice QTL or sQTL) can identify novel functions for
existing GWAS variants or suggest new associated variants in chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD). RNA sequencing was performed on whole blood from 376
subjects from the COPDGene Study. Using linear models, we identified 561,060
unique sQTL SNPs associated with 30,333 splice sites corresponding to 6,419
unique genes. Similarly, 708,928 unique eQTL SNPs involving 15,913 genes were
detected at 10% FDR. While there is overlap between sQTLs and eQTLs, 55.3% of
sQTLs are not eQTLs. Co-localization analysis revealed that 7 out of 21 loci
associated with COPD (p<1x10-6) in a published GWAS have at least one shared
causal variant between the GWAS and sQTL studies. Among the genes identified to
have splice sites associated with top GWAS SNPs was FBXO38, in which a novel exon
was discovered to be protective against COPD. Importantly, the sQTL in this locus
was validated by qPCR in both blood and lung tissue, demonstrating that splice
variants relevant to lung tissue can be identified in blood. Other identified
genes included CDK11A and SULT1A2. Overall, these data indicate that analysis of 
alternative splicing can provide novel insights into disease mechanisms. In
particular, we demonstrated that SNPs in a known COPD GWAS locus on chromosome
5q32 influence alternative splicing in the gene FBXO38.

As a novel kind of non-coding RNA, circular RNAs (circRNAs) were involved in
various biological processes. However, the role of circRNAs in the developmental 
process of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is still unclear. In the 
present study, by using a cell model of COPD in primary human small airway
epithelial cells (HSAECs) treated with or without cigarette smoke extract (CSE), 
we uncovered 4,379 previously unknown circRNAs in human cells and 903
smoke-specific circRNAs, with the help of RNA-sequencing and bioinformatic
analysis. Moreover, 3,872 up- and 4,425 down-regulated mRNAs were also identified
under CSE stimulation. Furthermore, a putative circRNA-microRNA-mRNA network was 
constructed for in-depth mechanism exploration, which indicated that
differentially expressed circRNAs could influence expression of some key genes
that participate in response to pentose phosphate pathway, ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporters, glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis pathway and cancer-related
pathways. Our research indicated that cigarette smoke had an influence on the
biogenesis of circRNAs and mRNAs. CircRNAs might be involved in the response to
CSE in COPD through the circRNA-mediated ceRNA networks.

Abnormal expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been confirmed to be
associated with many diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). To gain better understanding of the mechanism of COPD, we investigated
the lncRNA and mRNA profiles in the lung tissue of patients with COPD. According 
to the analysis, one of the significantly different lncRNAs, COPDA1, might
participate in the occurrence and development of COPD. Lung tissues were
collected from nonsmokers, smokers, or smokers with COPD for RNA sequencing.
Bioinformatic analysis and cell experiments were used to define the function of
COPDA1, and the effects of COPDA1 on intracellular Ca2+ concentration and cell
proliferation were examined after knockdown or overexpression of COPDA1. A number
of variations of lncRNAs were found in the comparison of nonsmokers, smokers, and
smokers with COPD. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes) pathway analyses indicated that smoking was involved in the activation
of cytokines and the cell cycle, which is associated with COPD. According to the 
lncRNA-mRNA-coexpressing network and enrichment analysis, COPDAz1 and one of its 
target genes, MS4A1 (membrane-spanning 4-domains family, subfamily A) were
investigated, and we discovered that the expression of MS4A1 was closely
associated with lncRNA COPDA1 expression in human bronchial smooth muscle cells
(HBSMCs). Further study showed that lncRNA COPDA1 upregulated the expression of
MS4A1 to increase store-operated calcium entry in the HBSMCs, resulting in the
promotion of the proliferation of smooth muscle cells as well as of airway
remodeling. COPDA1 might be involved in the regulation of certain signaling
pathways in COPD, might promote the proliferation of HBSMCs, and might also be
involved in facilitating airway remodeling.

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the reproducibility of
fluid-phase measurements in PBS-treated sputum supernatant, processed using the
two-step method, of healthy and stable COPD individuals.
Methods: Nine healthy subjects and 23 stable COPD patients provided sputum twice 
within 6 days. A two-step sputum processing method was used to obtain PBS-treated
supernatant and sputum cells. Soluble protein markers and IgG and IgM
autoantibody profiles in PBS supernatant were analyzed using customized
microarrays. Repeatability of measurements was assessed by paired-sample testing 
and an intraclass correlation coefficient, then graphically reported by
Bland-Altman plot.
Results: There was no significant difference between the repeated detection of
8/10 types of soluble protein markers, all 13 types of IgG autoantibodies, and
12/13 types of corresponding IgM autoantibodies in PBS supernatant. The
repeatability of measurements in PBS supernatant was substantial to very good for
interleukin 6 (IL6), IL8, IL13, IL10, IL33, vascular endothelial growth factor,
soluble receptor for advanced glycation end-products, and tumor necrosis
factor-α; for IgG autoantibodies against aggrecan, centromere protein B (CENP-B),
collagen II, collagen IV, cytochrome C, elastin, heat shock protein 47 (HSP47),
HSP70, and La/Sjögren syndrome type B antigen; for IgM autoantibodies against
CENP-B, collagen I, collagen II, collagen IV, cytokeratin 18, and HSP70; and for 
sputum neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils count. Bland-Altman plots
suggested good consistency within repeated measurements. Stable COPD patients
differed from healthy subjects in the proportion of neutrophils and eosinophils; 
relative fluorescence intensity of anti-cytochrome C IgG, anti-aggrecan IgM, and 
anti-cytochrome C IgM. There was a significant positive correlation for stable
COPD patients between sputum anti-collagen II IgG and post-bronchodilator FEV1%.
Conclusion: We confirmed fluid-phase measurements in PBS-treated sputum
supernatant by high-throughput techniques with good repeatability. We
demonstrated the presence of IgG and IgM autoantibodies to multiple antigens in
the airways of COPD patients.

The effects of phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors on gene expression changes in
BEAS-2B human airway epithelial cells are reported and discussed in relation to
the mechanism(s) of action of roflumilast in chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD). Microarray-based gene expression profiling failed to identify
mRNA transcripts that were differentially regulated by the PDE4 inhibitor
6-[3-(dimethylcarbamoyl)benzenesulphonyl]-4-[(3-methoxyphenyl)amino]-8-methylquin
oline-3-carboxamide (GSK 256066) after 1, 2, 6, or 18 hours of exposure. However,
real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that GSK 256066 was a weak 
stimulus, and the negative microarray results reflected low statistical power due
to small sample sizes. Furthermore, GSK 256066, roflumilast, and its biologically
active metabolite roflumilast N-oxide generally potentiated gene expression
changes produced by the long-acting β 2-adrenoceptor agonists (LABAs) salmeterol,
indacaterol, and formoterol. Many of these genes encode proteins with antiviral, 
anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial activities that could contribute to the
clinical efficacy of roflumilast in COPD. RNA-sequencing experiments established 
that the sensitivity of genes to salmeterol varied by ∼7.5-fold. Consequently,
the degree to which a PDE4 inhibitor potentiated the effect of a given
concentration of LABA was gene-dependent. Operational model fitting of
concentration-response curve data from cells subjected to fractional, β
2-adrenoceptor inactivation determined that PDE4 inhibition increased the potency
and doubled the efficacy of LABAs. Thus, adding roflumilast to standard triple
therapy, as COPD guidelines recommend, may have clinical relevance, especially in
target tissues where LABAs behave as partial agonists. Collectively, these
results suggest that the genomic impact of roflumilast, including its ability to 
augment LABA-induced gene expression changes, may contribute to its therapeutic
activity in COPD.

Lung disease accounts for every sixth death globally. Profiling the molecular
state of all lung cell types in health and disease is currently revolutionizing
the identification of disease mechanisms and will aid the design of novel
diagnostic and personalized therapeutic regimens. Recent progress in
high-throughput techniques for single-cell genomic and transcriptomic analyses
has opened up new possibilities to study individual cells within a tissue,
classify these into cell types, and characterize variations in their molecular
profiles as a function of genetics, environment, cell-cell interactions,
developmental processes, aging, or disease. Integration of these cell state
definitions with spatial information allows the in-depth molecular description of
cellular neighborhoods and tissue microenvironments, including the tissue
resident structural and immune cells, the tissue matrix, and the microbiome. The 
Human Cell Atlas consortium aims to characterize all cells in the healthy human
body and has prioritized lung tissue as one of the flagship projects. Here, we
present the rationale, the approach, and the expected impact of a Human Lung Cell
Atlas.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-induced fibroblast-to-myofibroblast
differentiation contributes to remodeling in chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, but whether this impacts the ability
of fibroblasts to support lung epithelial repair remains little explored. We
pretreated human lung fibroblasts [primary (phFB) or MRC5 cells] with recombinant
human TGF-β to induce myofibroblast differentiation, then cocultured them with
adult mouse lung epithelial cell adhesion molecule-positive cells (EpCAM+) to
investigate their capacity to support epithelial organoid formation in vitro.
While control phFB and MRC5 lung fibroblasts supported organoid formation of
mouse EpCAM+ cells, TGF-β pretreatment of both phFB and MRC5 impaired
organoid-supporting ability. We performed RNA sequencing of TGF-β-treated phFB,
which revealed altered expression of key Wnt signaling pathway components and
Wnt/β-catenin target genes, and modulated expression of secreted factors involved
in mesenchymal-epithelial signaling. TGF-β profoundly skewed the transcriptional 
program induced by the Wnt/β-catenin activator CHIR99021. Supplementing organoid 
culture media recombinant hepatocyte growth factor or fibroblast growth factor 7 
promoted organoid formation when using TGF-β pretreated fibroblasts. In
conclusion, TGF-β-induced myofibroblast differentiation results in Wnt/β-catenin 
pathway skewing and impairs fibroblast ability to support epithelial repair
likely through multiple mechanisms, including modulation of secreted growth
factors.

BACKGROUND: Multiple gene expression studies have been performed separately in
peripheral blood, lung, and airway tissues to study COPD. We performed
RNA-sequencing gene expression profiling of large-airway epithelium, alveolar
macrophage and peripheral blood samples from the same subset of COPD cases and
controls from the COPDGene study who underwent bronchoscopy at a single center.
Using statistical and gene set enrichment approaches, we sought to improve the
understanding of COPD by studying gene sets and pathways across these tissues,
beyond the individual genomic determinants.
METHODS: We performed differential expression analysis using RNA-seq data
obtained from 63 samples from 21 COPD cases and controls (includes four
non-smokers) via the R package DESeq2. We tested associations between gene
expression and variables related to lung function, smoking history, and CT scan
measures of emphysema and airway disease. We examined the correlation of
differential gene expression across the tissues and phenotypes, hypothesizing
that this would reveal preserved and private gene expression signatures. We
performed gene set enrichment analyses using curated databases and findings from 
prior COPD studies to provide biological and disease relevance.
RESULTS: The known smoking-related genes CYP1B1 and AHRR were among the top
differential expression results for smoking status in the large-airway epithelium
data. We observed a significant overlap of genes primarily across large-airway
and macrophage results for smoking and airway disease phenotypes. We did not
observe specific genes differentially expressed in all three tissues for any of
the phenotypes. However, we did observe hemostasis and immune signaling pathways 
in the overlaps across all three tissues for emphysema, and amyloid and
telomere-related pathways for smoking. In peripheral blood, the emphysema results
were enriched for B cell related genes previously identified in lung tissue
studies.
CONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analyses across COPD-relevant tissues and prior
studies revealed shared and tissue-specific disease biology. These replicated and
novel findings in the airway and peripheral blood have highlighted candidate

Knowledge on age-related miRNA changes in healthy individuals and their
interaction with mRNAs is lacking. We studied age-related mRNA and miRNA
expression changes and their interactions in normal airways. RNA and small RNA
sequencing was performed on bronchial biopsies of 86 healthy individuals (age:
18-73) to determine age-related expression changes. Per age-related miRNA we
determined the enrichment of age-related predicted targets and their correlation.
We identified 285 age-related genes and 27 age-related miRNAs. Pathway enrichment
showed that genes higher expressed with age were involved in synapse-related
processes. Genes lower expressed with age were involved in cell cycle regulation,
the immune system and DNA damage/repair. MiR-146a-5p, miR-146b-5p and miR-142-5p 
were lower expressed with increasing age and we found a significant enrichment
for predicted targets of these miRNAs among genes that were higher expressed with
age. The expression levels of the enriched predicted targets RIMS2 and IGSF1 were
negatively correlated with both miR-146a-5p and miR-146b-5p. RIMS2 was present in
the enriched process, i.e. positive regulation of synaptic transmission. In
conclusion, genes decreased with ageing are involved in several of the ageing
hallmarks. Genes higher expressed with ageing were involved in synapse-related
processes, of which RIMS2 is potentially regulated by two age-related miRNAs.

BACKGROUND: Aging is affected by genetic and environmental factors, and cigarette
smoking is strongly associated with accumulation of senescent cells. In this
study, we wanted to identify genes that may potentially be beneficial for cell
survival in response to cigarette smoke and thereby may contribute to development
of cellular senescence.
RESULTS: Primary human bronchial epithelial cells from five healthy donors were
cultured, treated with or without 1.5% cigarette smoke extract (CSE) for 24 h or 
were passaged into replicative senescence. Transcriptome changes were monitored
using RNA-seq in CSE and non-CSE exposed cells and those passaged into
replicative senescence. We found that, among 1534 genes differentially regulated 
during senescence and 599 after CSE exposure, 243 were altered in both
conditions, representing strong enrichment. Pathways and gene sets
overrepresented in both conditions belonged to cellular processes that regulate
reactive oxygen species, proteasome degradation, and NF-κB signaling.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer insights into gene expression responses during
cellular aging and cigarette smoke exposure, and identify potential molecular
pathways that are altered by cigarette smoke and may also promote airway
epithelial cell senescence.

BACKGROUND: Defects in the epithelial barrier have recently been associated with 
asthma and other allergies. The influence of laundry detergents on human
bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and their barrier function remain unknown.
OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effects of laundry detergents on cytotoxicity,
barrier function, the transcriptome, and the epigenome in HBECs.
METHODS: Air-liquid interface cultures of primary HBECs from healthy control
subjects, patients with asthma, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease were exposed to laundry detergents and detergent residue after rinsing.
Cytotoxicity and epithelial barrier function were evaluated. RNA sequencing,
Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing, and
DNA methylation arrays were used for checking the transcriptome and epigenome.
RESULTS: Laundry detergents and rinse residue showed dose-dependent toxic effects
on HBECs, with irregular cell shape and leakage of lactate dehydrogenase after
24 hours of exposure. A disrupted epithelial barrier function was found with
decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, increased paracellular flux, and
stratified tight junction (TJ) immunostaining in HBECs exposed to laundry
detergent at 1:25,000 dilutions or rinse residue at further 1:10 dilutions. RNA
sequencing analysis showed that lipid metabolism, apoptosis progress, and
epithelially derived alarmin-related gene expression were upregulated, whereas
cell adhesion-related gene expression was downregulated by laundry detergent at
1:50,000 dilutions after 24 hours of exposure without substantially affecting
chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation.
CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that laundry detergents, even at a very high
dilution, and rinse residue show significant cell-toxic and directly disruptive
effects on the TJ barrier integrity of HBECs without affecting the epigenome and 
TJ gene expression.

Long-term, low-dose azithromycin reduces exacerbation frequency in chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet the mechanism remains unclear. This
study characterised genome-wide gene expression changes in patients with
neutrophilic COPD following long-term, low-dose azithromycin treatment. Patients 
with neutrophilic COPD (>61% or >162×104 cells per mL sputum neutrophils) were
randomised to receive either azithromycin or placebo for 12 weeks. Sputum and
blood were obtained before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Gene expression was
defined using microarrays. Networks were analysed using the Search Tool for the
Retrieval of Interacting Gene database. In sputum, 403 genes were differentially 
expressed following azithromycin treatment (171 downregulated and 232
upregulated), and three following placebo treatment (one downregulated and two
upregulated) compared to baseline (adjusted p<0.05 by paired t-test, fold-change 
>1.5). In blood, 138 genes were differentially expressed with azithromycin (121
downregulated and 17 upregulated), and zero with placebo compared to baseline
(adjusted p<0.05 by paired t-test, fold-change >1.3). Network analysis revealed
one key network in both sputum (14 genes) and blood (46 genes), involving
interferon-stimulated genes, human leukocyte antigens and genes regulating T-cell
responses. Long-term, low-dose azithromycin is associated with downregulation of 
genes regulating antigen presentation, interferon and T-cell responses, and
numerous inflammatory pathways in the airways and blood of neutrophilic COPD
patients.

Comprehensive Analysis of miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA Networks in Non-Smoking and Smoking
Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

Qian Y, Mao ZD, Shi YJ, Liu ZG, Cao Q, Zhang Q.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of
morbidity and mortality worldwide. This study aimed to identify overlapping or
diverging dysregulated genes, lncRNAs, miRNAs and signaling pathways in smoking
and non-smoking chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: Compared to normal controls, we identified the shared and divergent
differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and lncRNAs
(DElncRNAs) in smoking and non-smoking COPD by RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics 
analysis. Functional annotation of DEmRNAs were performed. Both cis and
trans-target DEmRNAs of DElncRNAs were identified. The target DEmRNAs of DEmiRNAs
were identified as well. The DEmiRNA-DEmRNA-DElncRNA interaction network was
constructed. QRT-PCR was performed to validat the selected DEmiRNAs, DEmRNA and
DElncRNAs in COPD.
RESULTS: Compared to normal control, 1234 DEmRNAs, 96 DElncRNAs and 151 DEmiRNAs 
were identified in non-smoking patients with COPD; 670 DEmRNAs, 44 DElncRNAs and 
63 DEmiRNAs were identified in smoking patients with COPD. Leukocyte
transendothelial migration and pathways in cancer were significantly enriched
pathways in non-smoking and smoking COPD, respectively.
MiR-122-5p-A2M-LINC00987/A2M-AS1/ linc0061 interactions might play key roles in
COPD irrespective with the smoking status. Let-7-ADRB1-HLA-DQB1-AS1 might play a 
key role in the pathogenesis of smoking COPD while
miR-218-5p/miR15a-RORA-LOC101928100/LINC00861 and
miR-218-5p/miR15a-TGFβ3-RORA-AS1 interactions might involve with non-smoking
COPD.
CONCLUSION: We identified the shared and diverging genes, lncRNAs, miRNAs and
their interactions and pathways in smoking and non-smoking COPD which provided
clues for understanding the mechanism and developing novel diagnostic and
therapeutic strategies for COPD.

Inadequate DNA repair is implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the mechanisms that underlie inadequate DNA
repair in COPD are poorly understood. We applied an integrative genomic approach 
to identify DNA repair genes and pathways associated with COPD severity.We
measured the transcriptomic changes of 419 genes involved in DNA repair and DNA
damage tolerance that occur with severe COPD in three independent cohorts
(n=1129). Differentially expressed genes were confirmed with RNA sequencing and
used for patient clustering. Clinical and genome-wide transcriptomic differences 
were assessed following cluster identification. We complemented this analysis by 
performing gene set enrichment analysis, Z-score and weighted gene correlation
network analysis to identify transcriptomic patterns of DNA repair pathways
associated with clinical measurements of COPD severity.We found 15 genes involved
in DNA repair and DNA damage tolerance to be differentially expressed in severe
COPD. K-means clustering of COPD cases based on this 15-gene signature identified
three patient clusters with significant differences in clinical characteristics
and global transcriptomic profiles. Increasing COPD severity was associated with 
downregulation of the nucleotide excision repair pathway.Systematic analysis of
the lung tissue transcriptome of individuals with severe COPD identified DNA
repair responses associated with disease severity that may underlie COPD
pathogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Gene expression of specific therapeutic targets in non-malignant lung
tissue might play an important role in optimizing targeted therapies. This study 
aims to identify different expression patterns of fifteen genes important for
targeted therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: We prospectively collected tissue of NSCLC and non-malignant lung tissue
from 25 primary resected patients. RNA-sequencing and 450 K methylation array
profiling was applied to both NSCLC and non-malignant lung tissue and data were
analyzed for 14 target genes. We analyzed differential expression and methylation
as well as expression according to patient characteristics like smoking status,
histology, age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, C-reactive protein (CRP)
and gender. TCGA data served as a validation set.
RESULTS: Nineteen men and 6 women were included. Important targets like PD-L2
(p = 0.035), VEGFR2 (p < 0.001) and VEGFR3 (p < 0.001) were downregulated
(respective fold changes = 1.8, 3.1, 2.7, 3.5) in tumor compared to non-malignant
lung tissue. The TCGA set confirmed these findings almost universally. PD-L1
(p < 0.001) became also significantly downregulated in the TCGA set. In NSCLC,
MUC1 (p = 0.003) showed a higher expression in patients with a CRP < 5 mg/L
compared to > 5 mg/L. In the TCGA data but not in our primary data, PD-L1 & 2
were both borderline more expressed in tumors of active smokers vs. tumors of
ex-smokers (p = 0.044 and 0.052).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a lower PD-L1 & 2 and VEGFR expression in NSCLC 
vs. non-malignant lung tissue. Specific patient characteristics did not seem to
change the overall expression differences as they were in line with the overall
results. This information may contribute to the optimization of targeted
treatments.

GWAS have repeatedly mapped susceptibility loci for emphysema to genes that
modify hedgehog signaling, but the functional relevance of hedgehog signaling to 
this morbid disease remains unclear. In the current study, we identified a broad 
population of mesenchymal cells in the adult murine lung receptive to hedgehog
signaling, characterized by higher activation of hedgehog surrounding the
proximal airway relative to the distal alveoli. Single-cell RNA-sequencing showed
that the hedgehog-receptive mesenchyme is composed of mostly fibroblasts with
distinct proximal and distal subsets with discrete identities. Ectopic hedgehog
activation in the distal fibroblasts promoted expression of proximal fibroblast
markers and loss of distal alveoli and airspace enlargement of over 20% compared 
with controls. We found that hedgehog suppressed mesenchymal-derived mitogens
enriched in distal fibroblasts that regulate alveolar stem cell regeneration and 
airspace size. Finally, single-cell analysis of the human lung mesenchyme showed 
that segregated proximal-distal identity with preferential hedgehog activation in
the proximal fibroblasts was conserved between mice and humans. In conclusion, we
showed that differential hedgehog activation segregates mesenchymal identities of
distinct fibroblast subsets and that disruption of fibroblast identity can alter 
the alveolar stem cell niche, leading to emphysematous changes in the murine
lung.

Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial, opportunistic pathogen that causes
several serious conditions including meningitis, septicemia, endocarditis, and
pneumonia. It can be found in the oral biofilm, which may be a reservoir for
pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Subgingival colonization by 
A. baumannii is associated with chronic and aggressive periodontitis as well as
refractory periodontal disease. Porphyromonas gingivalis, a keystone periodontal 
pathogen localized to subgingival plaque, is also implicated in several chronic
conditions including aspiration pneumonia. Although both bacteria are found
together in subgingival plaque and can cause multiple polymicrobial infections,
nothing is known about the interactions between these two important human
pathogens. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to understand the
transcriptional response of both species as they adapt to heterotypic
communities. Among the differentially regulated genes were those encoding a
number of important virulence factors for both species including adhesion,
biofilm formation, and protein secretion. Additionally, the presence of
A. baumannii increased the abundance of P. gingivalis in model dual-species
communities. Collectively these results suggest that both P. gingivalis and
A. baumannii adapt to each other and have synergistic potential for increased
pathogenicity. In identifying the mechanisms that promote pathogenicity and
refractory disease, novel approaches to mitigate polymicrobial synergistic
interactions may be developed to treat or prevent associated diseases.

BACKGROUND: Understanding effects of acute smoke exposure (ASE) on airway
epithelial gene expression and their relationship with the effects of chronic
smoke exposure may provide biological insights into the development of
smoking-related respiratory diseases.
METHODS: Bronchial airway epithelial cell brushings were collected from 63
individuals without recent cigarette smoke exposure and before and 24 h after
smoking three cigarettes. RNA from these samples was profiled on Affymetrix Human
Gene 1.0 ST microarrays.
RESULTS: We identified 91 genes differentially expressed 24 h after ASE (false
discovery rate < 0.25). ASE induced genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism,
oxidative stress, and inflammation and repressed genes related to cilium
morphogenesis and cell cycle. While many genes altered by ASE are altered
similarly in chronic smokers, metallothionein genes are induced by ASE and
suppressed in chronic smokers. Metallothioneins are also suppressed in current
and former smokers with lung cancer relative to those without lung cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute exposure to as little as three cigarettes and chronic smoking 
induce largely concordant changes in airway epithelial gene expression.
Differences in short-term and long-term effects of smoking on metallothionein
expression and their relationship to lung cancer requires further study given
these enzymes' role in the oxidative stress response.

Urinary tract infection (UTI), which is typically caused by Escherichia coli (E. 
coli), is an insufficiently recognized co-morbidity among patients with chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Adequate treatment can be complicated by
resistance of the causative pathogen to beta-lactam antibiotics, which often
produce beta-lactamase enzymes that destroy the antibiotic. The beta-lactamase
family of enzymes is extremely diverse, including different types of enzyme and
mutant forms. In this study, we analyzed 580 patients with COPD (236 females and 
344 males) and thus found 218 patients with co-morbid UTIs, including 58 patients
with UTI caused by E. coli (38 females and 20 males). We also investigated cases 
of uncomplicated symptomatic and asymptomatic UTI caused by E. coli and the
presence of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics among those patients. The E.
coli strains resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics were selected for their ability
to grow on selective media, before DNA microarrays were applied for specific
identification of three beta-lactamase gene types (i.e., TEM, SHV and CTX-M).
Overall, 83% of E. coli strains responsible for UTIs in COPD patients carried
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes. The most prevalent were those producing
CTX-M, with CTX-M-15 being predominant. The rare CTX-M-27 and TEM-15 genes were
also detected in two samples. Three samples contained several extended-spectrum
beta-lactamase genes simultaneously (CTX-M-15 or CTX-M-14 plus SHV-5 or TEM-15). 
This high prevalence of resistant E. coli strains necessitates rational
antibiotic selection when treating UTI to prevent COPD exacerbations.
Additionally, antibiotic therapy should be aligned with and adapted to existing
and potential COPD co-morbidities.

Due to high levels of expression in aggressive tumors, high mobility group
AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) has recently attracted attention as a potential anti-tumor
target. However, HMGA1 is also expressed in normal somatic progenitor cells,
raising the question: how might systemic anti-HMGA1 therapies affect the
structure and function of normal tissue differentiation? In the present study,
RNA sequencing data demonstrated HMGA1 is highly expressed in human airway basal 
stem/progenitor cells (BC), but decreases with BC differentiation in air-liquid
interface cultures (ALI). BC collected from nonsmokers, healthy smokers, and
smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) displayed a range of
HMGA1 expression levels. Low initial expression levels of HMGA1 in BC were
associated with decreased ability to maintain a differentiated ALI epithelium.
HMGA1 down-regulation in BC diminished BC proliferation, suppressed gene
expression related to normal proliferation and differentiation, decreased airway 
epithelial resistance, suppressed junctional and cell polarity gene expression,
and delayed wound closure of airway epithelium following injury. Furthermore,
silencing of HMGA1 in airway BC in ALI increased the expression of genes
associated with airway remodeling in COPD including squamous,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and inflammatory genes. Together, the
data suggests HMGA1 plays a central role in normal airway differentiation, and
thus caution should be used to monitor airway epithelial structure and function
in the context of systemic HMGA1-targeted therapies.

The battery of regulatory tests used to evaluate the risk of novel tobacco
products such as heated tobacco products (THPs) presents some limitations
including a bias towards the apical endpoint tested, and limited information on
the mode of action. This is driving a paradigm shift to more holistic systems
biology approaches. In this study, we used RNA-sequencing to compare the
transcriptomic perturbations following acute exposure of a 3D airway tissue to
the aerosols from two commercial THPs and a reference 3R4F cigarette. 2809 RNAs
were differentially expressed for the 3R4F treatment and 115 and 2 RNAs for the
two THPs (pFDR < 0.05, FC > 1.5), respectively. The relationship between the
identified RNA features and gene ontologies were mapped showing a strong
association with stress response, xenobiotics metabolism, and COPD-related terms 
for 3R4F. In contrast, fewer ontologies were found enriched for the THPs
aerosols. "Response to wounding" was a common COPD-related term over-represented 
for the two THPs but at a reduced significance. Quantification of a cytokine
panel post-exposure confirmed a pro-inflammatory effect of cigarette smoke but
not for THPs. In conclusion, THPs have a reduced impact on gene expression
compared to 3R4F.

Recently developed RNA microarrays and high-throughput sequencing techniques have
demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in a wide
range of biological processes. Emerging evidence has confirmed the relevance of
lncRNAs to diverse types of human disease, including cancer and cardiovascular
disease. In this review, we discuss the important functions of lncRNAs in
respiratory diseases. Because the reviewed studies have mainly focused on
non-small cell lung cancer, future work will need to extend the studies into
other respiratory diseases. From a clinical perspective, targeting lncRNAs as a
novel therapeutic strategy in respiratory diseases will require further study to 
further clarify their biological functions.

Two cAMP signaling compartments centered on adenylyl cyclase (AC) exist in human 
airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells, one containing β2-adrenergic receptor AC6 and 
another containing E prostanoid receptor AC2. We hypothesized that different PDE 
isozymes selectively regulate cAMP signaling in each compartment. According to
RNA-sequencing data, 18 of 24 PDE genes were expressed in primary HASM cells
derived from age- and sex-matched donors with and without asthma. PDE8A was the
third most abundant of the cAMP-degrading PDE genes, after PDE4A and PDE1A.
Knockdown of PDE8A using shRNA evoked twofold greater cAMP responses to 1 μM
forskolin in the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Overexpression of AC2
did not alter this response, but overexpression of AC6 increased cAMP responses
an additional 80%. We examined cAMP dynamics in live HASM cells using a
fluorescence sensor. PF-04957325, a PDE8-selective inhibitor, increased basal
cAMP concentrations by itself, indicating a significant basal level of cAMP
synthesis. In the presence of an AC inhibitor to reduce basal signaling,
PF-04957325 accelerated cAMP production and increased the inhibition of cell
proliferation induced by isoproterenol, but it had no effect on cAMP
concentrations or cell proliferation regulated by prostaglandin E2. Lipid raft
fractionation of HASM cells revealed PDE8A immunoreactivity in buoyant fractions 
containing caveolin-1 and AC5/6 immunoreactivity. Thus, PDE8 is expressed in
lipid rafts of HASM cells, where it specifically regulates β2-adrenergic receptor
AC6 signaling without effects on signaling by the E prostanoid receptors 2/4-AC2 
complex. In airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, PDE8 may represent a novel therapeutic target to modulate HASM
responsiveness and airway remodeling.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular function of splicing factor SRSF6 in
colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and discover candidate chemicals for cancer
therapy through targeting SRSF6.
DESIGN: We performed comprehensive analysis for the expression of SRSF6 in 311
CRC samples, The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. 
Functional analysis of SRSF6 in CRC was performed in vitro and in vivo.
SRSF6-regulated alternative splicing (AS) and its binding motif were identified
by next-generation RNA-sequencing and RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing
(RIP-seq), which was validated by gel shift and minigene reporter assay. ZO-1
exon23 AS was investigated to mediate the function of SRSF6 in vitro and in vivo.
Based on the analysis of domain-specific role, SRSF6-targeted inhibitor was
discovered de novoby virtual screening in 4855 FDA-approved drugs and its
antitumour effects were evaluated in vitroand in vivo.
RESULTS: SRSF6 was frequently upregulated in CRC samples and associated with poor
prognosis, which promoted proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We
identified SRSF6-regulated AS targets and discovered the SRSF6 binding motif.
Particularly, SRSF6 regulates ZO-1 aberrant splicing to function as an oncogene
by binding directly to its motif in the exon23. Based on the result that SRSF6
RRM2 domain plays key roles in regulating AS and biological function,
indacaterol, a β2-adrenergic receptor agonist approved for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease treatment, is identified as the inhibitor of SRSF6 to suppress 
CRC tumourigenicity.
CONCLUSIONS: SRSF6 functions the important roles in mediating CRC progression
through regulating AS, and indacaterol is repositioned as an antitumour drug
through targeting SRSF6.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking is the leading modifiable risk factor for disease
and death worldwide. Previous studies quantifying gene-level expression have
documented the effect of smoking on mRNA levels. Using RNA sequencing, it is
possible to analyze the impact of smoking on complex regulatory phenomena (e.g.
alternative splicing, differential isoform usage) leading to a more detailed
understanding of the biology underlying smoking-related disease.
METHODS: We used whole-blood RNA sequencing to describe gene and exon-level
expression differences between 229 current and 286 former smokers in the COPDGene
study. We performed differential gene expression and differential exon usage
analyses using the voom/limma and DEXseq R packages. Samples from current and
former smokers were compared while controlling for age, gender, race, lifetime
smoke exposure, cell counts, and technical covariates.
RESULTS: At an adjusted p-value <0.05, 171 genes were differentially expressed
between current and former smokers. Differentially expressed genes included 7
long non-coding RNAs that have not been previously associated with smoking:
LINC00599, LINC01362, LINC00824, LINC01624, RP11-563D10.1, RP11-98G13.1,
AC004791.2. Secondary analysis of acute smoking (having smoked within 2-h)
revealed 5 of the 171 smoking genes demonstrated an acute response above the
baseline effect of chronic smoking. Exon-level analyses identified 9 exons from 8
genes with significant differential usage by smoking status, suggesting
smoking-induced changes in isoform expression.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcriptomic changes at the gene and exon levels from whole blood 
can refine our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the response 
to smoking.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and
mortality worldwide. Patients with chronic respiratory diseases, such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are exposed to a higher risk of developing 
lung cancer. Chronic inflammation may play an important role in the lung
carcinogenesis among those patients. The present study aimed at identifying
candidate biomarker predicting lung cancer risk among patients with chronic
respiratory diseases.
METHODS: We applied clinical bioinformatics tools to analyze different gene
profile datasets with a special focus on screening the potential biomarker during
chronic inflammation-lung cancer transition. Then we adopted an in vitro model
based on LPS-challenged A549 cells to validate the biomarker through
RNA-sequencing, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, and western
blot analysis.
RESULTS: Bioinformatics analyses of the 16 enrolled GSE datasets from Gene
Expression Omnibus online database showed myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D)
level significantly increased in COPD patients coexisting non-small-cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC). Inflammation challenge increased MEF2D expression in NSCLC
cell line A549, associated with the severity of inflammation. Extracellular
signal-regulated protein kinase inhibition could reverse the up-regulation of
MEF2D in inflammation-activated A549. MEF2D played a critical role in NSCLC cell 
bio-behaviors, including proliferation, differentiation, and movement.
CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory conditions led to increased MEF2D expression, which
might further contribute to the development of lung cancer through influencing
cancer microenvironment and cell bio-behaviors. MEF2D might be a potential
biomarker during chronic inflammation-lung cancer transition, predicting the risk
of lung cancer among patients with chronic respiratory diseases.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation regulates together with other epigenetic mechanisms
the transcriptional activity of genes and is involved in the pathogenesis of
malignant diseases including lung cancer. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
various tumor suppressor genes are already known to be tumor-specifically
methylated. However, from the vast majority of a large number of genes which were
identified to be tumor-specifically methylated, tumor-specific methylation was
unknown so far. Thus, the major aim of this study was to investigate in detail
the mechanism(s) responsible for transcriptional regulation of the genes SPAG6
and L1TD1 in NSCLCs.
METHODS: We analysed publically available RNA-sequencing data and performed gene 
expression analyses by RT-PCR. DNA methylation analyses were done by
methylation-sensitive high-resolution melt analyses and bisulfite genomic
sequencing. We additionally investigated protein expression using
immunohistochemistry. Cell culture experiments included tumor cell growth,
proliferation, viability as well as colony formation assays. Moreover, we
performed xenograft experiments using immunodeficient mice.
RESULTS: We observed frequent downregulation of SPAG6 and L1TD1 mRNA expression
in primary tumor ﻿(TU) samples compared to corresponding non-malignant lung
tissue (NL) samples of NSCLC patients. We furthermore observed re-expression of
both genes after treatment with epigenetically active drugs in most NSCLC cell
lines with downregulated SPAG6 and L1TD1 mRNA expression. Frequent tumor-specific
DNA methylation of SPAG6 and L1TD1 was detected when we analysed TU and
corresponding NL samples of NSCLC patients. ROC curve analyses demonstrated that 
methylation of both genes is able to distinguish between TU and NL samples of
these patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed a close association between
SPAG6/L1TD1 methylation and downregulated protein expression of these genes.
Moreover, by performing functional assays we observed reduced cell growth,
proliferation and viability of pCMV6-L1TD1 transfected NSCLC cells. In addition, 
reduced volumes of tumors derived from pCMV6-L1TD1 compared to pCMV6-ENTRY
transfected NCI-H1975 cells were seen in a xenograft tumor model.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results demonstrate that SPAG6 and L1TD1 are
tumor-specifically methylated in NSCLCs and that DNA methylation is involved in
the transcriptional regulation of these genes. Moreover, in vitro as well as in
vivo experiments revealed tumor-cell growth suppressing properties of L1TD1 in
NSCLC cells.

Diseases involving the distal lung alveolar epithelium include chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and lung
adenocarcinoma. Accurate labeling of specific cell types is critical for
determining the contribution of each to the pathogenesis of these diseases. The
distal lung alveolar epithelium is composed of two cell types, alveolar
epithelial type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) cells. Although cell type-specific
markers, most prominently surfactant protein C, have allowed detailed lineage
tracing studies of AT2 cell differentiation and the cells' roles in disease,
studies of AT1 cells have been hampered by a lack of genes with expression unique
to AT1 cells. In this study, we performed genome-wide expression profiling of
multiple rat organs together with purified rat AT2, AT1, and in vitro
differentiated AT1-like cells, resulting in the identification of 54 candidate
AT1 cell markers. Cross-referencing with genes up-regulated in human in vitro
differentiated AT1-like cells narrowed the potential list to 18 candidate genes. 
Testing the top four candidate genes at RNA and protein levels revealed GRAM
domain 2 (GRAMD2), a protein of unknown function, as highly specific to AT1
cells. RNA sequencing (RNAseq) confirmed that GRAMD2 is transcriptionally silent 
in human AT2 cells. Immunofluorescence verified that GRAMD2 expression is
restricted to the plasma membrane of AT1 cells and is not expressed in bronchial 
epithelial cells, whereas reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
confirmed that it is not expressed in endothelial cells. Using GRAMD2 as a new
AT1 cell-specific gene will enhance AT1 cell isolation, the investigation of
alveolar epithelial cell differentiation potential, and the contribution of AT1
cells to distal lung diseases.

Chronic lung disease of prematurity/bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the
leading cause of perinatal morbidity in developed countries. Inflammation is a
prominent finding. Currently available interventions have associated toxicities
and limited efficacy. While BPD often resolves in childhood, survivors of preterm
birth are at risk for acquired respiratory disease in early life and are more
likely to develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adulthood. We
previously cloned Crispld2 (Lgl1), a glucocorticoid-regulated mesenchymal
secretory protein that modulates lung branching and alveogenesis through
mesenchymal-epithelial interactions. Absence of Crispld2 is embryonic lethal.
Heterozygous Crispld2+/- mice display features of BPD, including distal airspace 
enlargement, disruption of elastin, and neonatal lung inflammation. CRISPLD2 also
plays a role in human fetal lung fibroblast cell expansion, migration, and
mesenchymal-epithelial signaling. This study assessed the effects of endogenous
and exogenous CRISPLD2 on expression of proinflammatory mediators in human fetal 
and adult (normal and COPD) lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells. CRISPLD2
expression was upregulated in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human fetal lung
fibroblast line (MRC5). LPS-induced upregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines
IL-8 and CCL2 was exacerbated in MRC5-CRISPLD2(knockdown) cells. siRNA
suppression of endogenous CRISPLD2 in adult lung fibroblasts (HLFs) led to
augmented expression of IL-8, IL-6, CCL2. LPS-stimulated expression of
proinflammatory mediators by human lung epithelial HAEo- cells was attenuated by 
purified secretory CRISPLD2. RNA sequencing results from HLF-CRISPLD2(knockdown) 
suggest roles for CRISPLD2 in extracellular matrix and in inflammation. Our data 
suggest that suppression of CRISPLD2 increases the risk of lung inflammation in
early life and adulthood.

RATIONALE: Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) can have a detrimental role 
in disease pathogenesis.
OBJECTIVES: To identify dysregulated miRNAs in lung tissue of patients with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS: We performed miRNA and mRNA profiling using high throughput stem-loop
reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction and mRNA microarray,
respectively, on lung tissue of 30 patients (screening cohort) encompassing 8
never-smokers, 10 smokers without airflow limitation, and 12 smokers with COPD.
Differential expression of miRNA-218-5p (miR-218-5p) was validated by
reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction in an independent
cohort of 71 patients, an in vivo murine model of COPD, and primary human
bronchial epithelial cells. Localization of miR-218-5p was assessed by in situ
hybridization. In vitro and in vivo perturbation of miR-218-5p combined with RNA 
sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis was used to elucidate its functional 
role in COPD pathogenesis.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Several miRNAs were differentially expressed among
the different patient groups. Interestingly, miR-218-5p was significantly
down-regulated in smokers without airflow limitation and in patients with COPD
compared with never-smokers. Decreased pulmonary expression of miR-218-5p was
validated in an independent validation cohort, in cigarette smoke-exposed mice,
and in human bronchial epithelial cells. Importantly, expression of miR-218-5p
strongly correlated with airway obstruction. Furthermore, cellular localization
of miR-218-5p in human and murine lung revealed highest expression of miR-218-5p 
in the bronchial airway epithelium. Perturbation experiments with a miR-218-5p
mimic or inhibitor demonstrated a protective role of miR-218-5p in cigarette
smoke-induced inflammation and COPD.
CONCLUSIONS: We highlight a role for miR-218-5p in the pathogenesis of COPD.

Smoking is associated with several serious diseases, such as lung cancer and
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Within our systems toxicology
framework, we are assessing whether potential modified risk tobacco products
(MRTP) can reduce smoking-related health risks compared to conventional
cigarettes. In this article, we evaluated to what extent 2D-PAGE/MALDI MS/MS
(2D-PAGE) can complement the iTRAQ LC-MS/MS results from a previously reported
mouse inhalation study, in which we assessed a prototypic MRTP (pMRTP). Selected 
differentially expressed proteins identified by both LC-MS/MS and 2D-PAGE
approaches were further verified using reverse-phase protein microarrays.
LC-MS/MS captured the effects of cigarette smoke (CS) on the lung proteome more
comprehensively than 2D-PAGE. However, an integrated analysis of both proteomics 
data sets showed that 2D-PAGE data complement the LC-MS/MS results by supporting 
the overall trend of lower effects of pMRTP aerosol than CS on the lung proteome.
Biological effects of CS exposure supported by both methods included increases in
immune-related, surfactant metabolism, proteasome, and actin cytoskeleton protein
clusters. Overall, while 2D-PAGE has its value, especially as a complementary
method for the analysis of effects on intact proteins, LC-MS/MS approaches will
likely be the method of choice for proteome analysis in systems toxicology
investigations.SIGNIFICANCE: Quantitative proteomics is anticipated to play a
growing role within systems toxicology assessment frameworks in the future. To
further understand how different proteomics technologies can contribute to
toxicity assessment, we conducted a quantitative proteomics analysis using
2D-PAGE and isobaric tag-based LC-MS/MS approaches and compared the results
produced from the 2 approaches. Using a prototypic modified risk tobacco product 
(pMRTP) as our test item, we show compared with cigarette smoke, how 2D-PAGE
results can complement and support LC-MS/MS data, demonstrating the much lower
effects of pMRTP aerosol than cigarette smoke on the mouse lung proteome. The
combined analysis of 2D-PAGE and LC-MS/MS data identified an effect of cigarette 
smoke on the proteasome and actin cytoskeleton in the lung.

HIV infection is associated with impaired lung gas transfer as indicated by a low
diffusing capacity (DLCO), but the mechanisms are not well understood. We
hypothesized that HIV-associated gas exchange impairment is indicative of
system-wide perturbations that could be reflected by alterations in peripheral
blood leukocyte (PBL) gene expression. Forty HIV-infected (HIV(+)) and uninfected
(HIV(-)) men with preserved versus low DLCO were enrolled. All subjects were
current smokers and those with acute illness, lung diseases other than COPD or
asthma were excluded. Total RNA was extracted from PBLs and hybridized to
whole-genome microarrays. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed
between HIV(+) versus HIV(-) subjects with preserved DLCO and those with low DLCO
to identify differentially activated pathways. Using pathway-based analyses, we
found that in subjects with preserved DLCO, HIV infection is associated with
activation of processes involved in immunity, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Applying
a similar analysis to subjects with low DLCO, we identified a much broader
repertoire of pro-inflammatory and immune-related pathways in HIV(+) patients
relative to HIV(-) subjects, with up-regulation of multiple interleukin pathways,
interferon signaling, and toll-like receptor signaling. We confirmed elevated
circulating levels of IL-6 in HIV(+) patients with low DLCO relative to the other
groups. Our findings reveal that PBLs of subjects with HIV infection and low DLCO
are distinguished by widespread enrichment of immuno-inflammatory programs.
Activation of these pathways may alter the biology of circulating leukocytes and 
play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated gas exchange impairment.

Microarrays are a powerful and effective tool that allows the detection of
genome-wide gene expression differences between controls and disease conditions. 
They have been broadly applied to investigate the pathobiology of diverse forms
of pulmonary hypertension, namely group 1, including patients with idiopathic
pulmonary arterial hypertension, and group 3, including pulmonary hypertension
associated with chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. To date, numerous human microarray
studies have been conducted to analyse global (lung homogenate samples),
compartment-specific (laser capture microdissection), cell type-specific
(isolated primary cells) and circulating cell (peripheral blood) expression
profiles. Combined, they provide important information on development,
progression and the end-stage disease. In the future, system biology approaches, 
expression of noncoding RNAs that regulate coding RNAs, and direct comparison
between animal models and human disease might be of importance.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Lower respiratory tract infections remain one of the leading
causes of death in the world. Recently, the introduction of molecular methods
based on DNA sequencing and microarrays for the identification of nonculturable
microorganisms and subspecies variations has challenged the previous 'one bug -
one disease' paradigm, providing us with a broader view on human microbial
communities and their role in the development of infectious diseases. The purpose
of this review is to describe recent understanding of the role of microbiome and 
bacterial biofilm in the development of lung infections, and, at the same time,
to present new areas of research opportunities.
RECENT FINDINGS: The review describes recent literature in cystic fibrosis
patients, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, and literature in
mechanically ventilated patients that helped to elucidate the role of microbiome 
and biofilm formation in the development of pneumonia.
SUMMARY: The characterization of the human microbiome and biofilms has changed
our understanding of lower respiratory tract infections. More comprehensive,
sensitive, and fast methods for bacterial, fungal, and viral detection are
warranted to establish the colonization of the lower respiratory tract in healthy
individuals and sick patients. Future research might explore the global
bacterial, fungal, and viral pulmonary ecosystems and their interdependence to
target novel preventive approaches and therapeutic strategies in chronic and
acute lung infections.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is linked to both cigarette smoking 
and genetic determinants. We have previously identified iron-responsive
element-binding protein 2 (IRP2) as an important COPD susceptibility gene and
have shown that IRP2 protein is increased in the lungs of individuals with COPD. 
Here we demonstrate that mice deficient in Irp2 were protected from cigarette
smoke (CS)-induced experimental COPD. By integrating RNA immunoprecipitation
followed by sequencing (RIP-seq), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and gene expression
and functional enrichment clustering analysis, we identified Irp2 as a regulator 
of mitochondrial function in the lungs of mice. Irp2 increased mitochondrial iron
loading and levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), which led to mitochondrial
dysfunction and subsequent experimental COPD. Frataxin-deficient mice, which had 
higher mitochondrial iron loading, showed impaired airway mucociliary clearance
(MCC) and higher pulmonary inflammation at baseline, whereas mice deficient in
the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase, which have reduced COX, were protected
from CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and impairment of MCC. Mice treated with a
mitochondrial iron chelator or mice fed a low-iron diet were protected from
CS-induced COPD. Mitochondrial iron chelation also alleviated CS-induced
impairment of MCC, CS-induced pulmonary inflammation and CS-associated lung
injury in mice with established COPD, suggesting a critical functional role and
potential therapeutic intervention for the mitochondrial-iron axis in COPD.

Increased Transcript Complexity in Genes Associated with Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease.

Carolina, United States of America.

Genome-wide association studies aim to correlate genotype with phenotype. Many
common diseases including Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Chronic 
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are complex genetic traits with hundreds of 
different loci that are associated with varied disease risk. Identifying common
features in the genes associated with each disease remains a challenge.
Furthermore, the role of post-transcriptional regulation, and in particular
alternative splicing, is still poorly understood in most multigenic diseases. We 
therefore compiled comprehensive lists of genes associated with Type II diabetes,
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and COPD in an attempt to identify common features of
their corresponding mRNA transcripts within each gene set. The SERPINA1 gene is a
well-recognized genetic risk factor of COPD and it produces 11 transcript
variants, which is exceptional for a human gene. This led us to hypothesize that 
other genes associated with COPD, and complex disorders in general, are highly
transcriptionally diverse. We found that COPD-associated genes have a
statistically significant enrichment in transcript complexity stemming from a
disproportionately high level of alternative splicing, however, Type II Diabetes,
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease genes were not significantly enriched. We
also identified a subset of transcriptionally complex COPD-associated genes
(~40%) that are differentially expressed between mild, moderate and severe COPD. 
Although the genes associated with other lung diseases are not extensively
documented, we found preliminary data that idiopathic pulmonary disease genes,
but not cystic fibrosis modulators, are also more transcriptionally complex.
Interestingly, complex COPD transcripts are more often the product of alternative
acceptor site usage. To verify the biological importance of these alternative
transcripts, we used RNA-sequencing analyses to determine that COPD-associated
genes are frequently expressed in lung and liver tissues and are regulated in a
tissue-specific manner. Additionally, many complex COPD-associated genes are
spliced differently between COPD and non-COPD patients. Our analysis therefore
suggests that post-transcriptional regulation, particularly alternative splicing,
is an important feature specific to COPD disease etiology that warrants further
investigation.

The heterogeneous clinical phenotypes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) challenge successful drug development. To identify COPD subgroups beyond
clinical phenotypes, we interrogated blood immune cell profiles and ex-vivo
responses of current and former smokers, with or without COPD, in the
longitudinal COPD Genetic Epidemiology study (COPDGene) cohort. CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells and monocytes were profiled by flow cytometry. Microarray analysis was
performed on the RNA from the aforementioned isolated cells. T-cell directed
whole blood ex-vivo stimulation was used to assess functional responses. Blood
CD4+ T-cell transcript analysis distinguished patients with COPD from control
smokers and also enriched for a subset of patients with COPD that had a history
of exacerbations of the disease. Analogous analyses of CD8+ T cells and monocytes
failed to discriminate patients with COPD from the control population. Patients
with COPD had a diminished cytokine response, compared to control smokers,
characterized by low levels of granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulation factor
(GM-CSF), interferon gamma (IFN-ɣ), interleukin one-alpha (IL-1α), tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-α) and tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-β) secreted in response 
to T-cell directed ex-vivo stimulation. This cytokine response associated with
baseline disease severity (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1]%
predicted), rapidly declining lung function, and emphysema. Our observations
indicate that COPD phenotypes can be further differentiated based on blood CD4+
T-cell profiles and resultant immune responses, suggesting a role for these cells
in COPD pathophysiology.

Observational studies have suggested that statins may have beneficial effects on 
outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. These effects 
may be mediated through an anti-inflammatory effect of statins. The purpose of
this pilot-study was to determine whether statins have an anti-inflammatory
effect on the lungs of COPD patients. We conducted randomized, controlled,
parallel group pilot-study to compare the effects of atorvastatin (n=12) or
placebo (n=6) on lung inflammation in patients with mild to moderate COPD. The
primary endpoint was change in CD45+ cells expression measured by
immunohistochemistry and changes in expression of genes measured using
microarrays in lung biopsy (TBB) samples before and after 12 weeks of treatment
with atorvastatin 40 mg/day. All subjects had spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing
capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), St George's Respiratory
Questionnaire (SGRQ), 6 minute walk distance (6 MWD), serum lipids, hs-CRP,
induced sputum (IS), bronchoscopy and TBB carried out at baseline and after
treatment. TBB specimens were processed for histology, immunohistochemistry and
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) profiling. Seventeen subjects completed
the study. There was a significant improvement in SGRQ with mean SGRQ decreased
by 12 points after treatment with atorvastatin (P=0.012). Atorvastatin treatment 
produced a significant 34% reduction in sputum neutrophil count, and a 57%
reduction in CD45+ cells in lung biopsies (expressed as integrated optical
density -IOD; median IOD 62.51% before, 27.01% after atorvastatin treatment,
P=0.008). In patients' lung tissue atorvastatin treatment produced downregulation
of key genes involved in inflammatory processes, immune response, and leukocyte
activation. These data demonstrate the pulmonary anti-inflammatory effects of
atorvastatin in COPD patients with the potential for beneficial clinical
effects.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01748279.

BACKGROUND: Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) has significant systemic
effects beyond the lungs amongst which muscle wasting is a prominent contributor 
to exercise limitation and an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality.
The molecular mechanisms leading to skeletal muscle dysfunction/wasting are not
fully understood and are likely to be multi-factorial. The need to develop
therapeutic strategies aimed at improving skeletal muscle dysfunction/wasting
requires a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for these
abnormalities. Microarrays are powerful tools that allow the investigation of the
expression of thousands of genes, virtually the whole genome, simultaneously. We 
aim at identifying genes and molecular pathways involved in skeletal muscle
wasting in COPD.
METHODS: We assessed and compared the vastus lateralis transcriptome of COPD
patients with low fat free mass index (FFMI) as a surrogate of muscle mass
(COPDL) (FEV1 30 ± 3.6%pred, FFMI 15 ± 0.2 Kg.m(-2)) with patients with COPD and 
normal FFMI (COPDN) (FEV1 44 ± 5.8%pred, FFMI 19 ± 0.5 Kg.m(-2)) and a group of
age and sex matched healthy controls (C) (FEV1 95 ± 3.9%pred, FFMI 20 ± 0.8
Kg.m(-2)) using Agilent Human Whole Genome 4x44K microarrays. The altered
expression of several of these genes was confirmed by real time TaqMan PCR.
Protein levels of P21 were assessed by immunoblotting.
RESULTS: A subset of 42 genes was differentially expressed in COPDL in comparison
to both COPDN and C (PFP < 0.05; -1.5 ≥ FC ≥ 1.5). The altered expression of
several of these genes was confirmed by real time TaqMan PCR and correlated with 
different functional and structural muscle parameters. Five of these genes
(CDKN1A, GADD45A, PMP22, BEX2, CGREF1, CYR61), were associated with cell cycle
arrest and growth regulation and had been previously identified in studies
relating muscle wasting and ageing. Protein levels of CDKN1A, a recognized marker
of premature ageing/cell cycle arrest, were also found to be increased in COPDL.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence of differentially expressed genes in
peripheral muscle in COPD patients corresponding to relevant biological processes
associated with skeletal muscle wasting and provides potential targets for future
therapeutic interventions to prevent loss of muscle function and mass in COPD.

The advent of techniques such as microarrays and high-throughput sequencing has
revolutionized our ability to examine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression within the 
respiratory system. Importantly, these approaches have also uncovered the
widespread expression of "noncoding RNAs," including microRNAs and long noncoding
RNAs, which impact biologic responses through the regulation of mRNA
transcription and/or translation. To date, most studies of the role of noncoding 
RNAs have focused on microRNAs, which regulate mRNA translation via the RNA
interference pathway. These studies have shown changes in microRNA expression in 
cells and tissues derived from patients with asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, cystic
fibrosis, COPD, and non-small cell lung cancer. Although the evidence is
currently limited, we review the work that has been carried out in cell and
animal models that has identified the function and mechanism of action of a small
number of these microRNAs in disease etiology. In addition to microRNAs, we
assess the emerging evidence that long noncoding RNAs regulate respiratory
phenotype. Because these investigations into long noncoding RNAs were performed
almost exclusively in non-small cell lung cancer, future work will need to extend
these into other respiratory diseases and to analyze how microRNAs and long
noncoding RNAs interact to regulate mRNA expression. From a clinical perspective,
the targeting of noncoding RNAs as a novel therapeutic approach will require a
deeper understanding of their function and mechanism of action. However, in the
short term, changes in miRNA and long noncoding RNA expression are likely to be
of use as biomarkers for disease stratification and/or assessment of drug action.

RATIONALE: The development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in patients with
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) is associated with increased morbidity.
OBJECTIVES: To elucidate whether vascular remodeling in a well-characterized
PH-COPD and PH-IPF patient cohort results from similar or divergent molecular
changes.
METHODS: Vascular remodeling of donor, PH-COPD, and PH-IPF pulmonary arteries was
assessed. Laser capture microdissected pulmonary artery profiles in combination
with whole genome microarrays were performed.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pulmonary arteries from patients with COPD and IPF
with PH exhibited remodeling of vascular layers and reduction of lumen area.
Pathway analyses comparing normalized gene expression profiles obtained from
patients with PH-IPF or PH-COPD revealed the retinol and extracellular matrix
(ECM) receptor interaction to be the most perturbed processes. Within the
ECM-receptor pathway, differential regulation of 5 out of the top 10 results
(collagen, type III, α-1; tenascin C; collagen, type VI, α-3; thrombospondin 2;
and von Willebrand factor) were verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction
and immunohistochemical staining.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite clinical and histologic vascular remodeling in all patients 
with PH-COPD and PH-IPF, differential gene expression pattern was present in
pulmonary artery profiles. Several genes involved in retinol metabolism and ECM
receptor interaction enable discrimination of vascular remodeling in PH-IPF or
PH-COPD. This suggests that pulmonary arterial remodeling in PH-COPD and PH-IPF
is caused by different molecular mechanisms and may require specific therapeutic 
options.

BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is the main risk factor of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) but not all smokers develop the disease. An abnormal
pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response to smoking is thought to play a
major pathogenic role in COPD, but this has never been tested directly.
METHODS: We studied the systemic biomarker and leukocyte transcriptomic response 
(Affymetrix microarrays) to smoking exposure in 10 smokers with COPD and 10
smokers with normal spirometry. We also studied 10 healthy never smokers (not
exposed to smoking) as controls. Because some aspects of COPD may differ in males
and females, and the inflammatory response to other stressors (infection) might
be different in man and women, we stratified participant recruitment by sex.
Differentially expressed genes were validated by q-PCR. Ontology enrichment was
evaluated and interaction networks inferred.
RESULTS: Principal component analysis identified sex differences in the leukocyte
transcriptomic response to acute smoking. In both genders, we identified genes
that were differentially expressed in response to smoking exclusively in COPD
patients (COPD related signature) or smokers with normal spirometry (Smoking
related signature), their ontologies and interaction networks.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of an experimental intervention (smoking exposure) to
investigate the transcriptomic response of peripheral leukocytes in COPD is a
step beyond the standard case-control transcriptomic profiling carried out so
far, and has facilitated the identification of novel COPD and Smoking expression 
related signatures which differ in males and females.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and candidate gene studies have identified
a number of risk loci associated with the smoking-related disease COPD, a
disorder that originates in the airway epithelium. Since airway basal cell (BC)
stem/progenitor cells exhibit the earliest abnormalities associated with smoking 
(hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia), we hypothesized that smoker BC have a
dysregulated transcriptome, enriched, in part, at known GWAS/candidate gene loci.
Massive parallel RNA sequencing was used to compare the transcriptome of BC
purified from the airway epithelium of healthy nonsmokers (n = 10) and healthy
smokers (n = 7). The chromosomal location of the differentially expressed genes
was compared to loci identified by GWAS to confer risk for COPD. Smoker BC have
676 genes differentially expressed compared to nonsmoker BC, dominated by smoking
up-regulation. Strikingly, 166 (25%) of these genes are located on chromosome 19,
with 13 localized to 19q13.2 (p<10⁻⁴ compared to chance), including 4 genes
(NFKBIB, LTBP4, EGLN2 and TGFB1) associated with risk for COPD. These
observations provide the first direct connection between known genetic risks for 
smoking-related lung disease and airway BC, the population of lung cells that
undergo the earliest changes associated with smoking.

Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) eliminates 
many epigenetic modifications that characterize differentiated cells. In this
study, we tested whether functional differences between chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and non-COPD fibroblasts could be reduced utilizing this
approach. Primary fibroblasts from non-COPD and COPD patients were reprogrammed
to iPSCs. Reprogrammed iPSCs were positive for oct3/4, nanog, and sox2, formed
embryoid bodies in vitro, and induced teratomas in nonobese diabetic/severe
combined immunodeficient mice. Reprogrammed iPSCs were then differentiated into
fibroblasts (non-COPD-i and COPD-i) and were assessed either functionally by
chemotaxis and gel contraction or for gene expression by microarrays and compared
with their corresponding primary fibroblasts. Primary COPD fibroblasts contracted
three-dimensional collagen gels and migrated toward fibronectin less robustly
than non-COPD fibroblasts. In contrast, redifferentiated fibroblasts from iPSCs
derived from the non-COPD and COPD fibroblasts were similar in response in both
functional assays. Microarray analysis identified 1,881 genes that were
differentially expressed between primary COPD and non-COPD fibroblasts, with 605 
genes differing by more than twofold. After redifferentiation, 112 genes were
differentially expressed between COPD-i and non-COPD-i with only three genes by
more than twofold. Similar findings were observed with microRNA (miRNA)
expression: 56 miRNAs were differentially expressed between non-COPD and COPD
primary cells; after redifferentiation, only 3 miRNAs were differentially
expressed between non-COPD-i and COPD-i fibroblasts. Interestingly, of the 605
genes that were differentially expressed between COPD and non-COPD fibroblasts,
293 genes were changed toward control after redifferentiation. In conclusion,
functional and epigenetic alterations of COPD fibroblasts can be reprogrammed
through formation of iPSCs.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (MiRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene
expression. The aim of this study was to identify miRNAs differentially expressed
between mild and moderately emphysematous lung, as well as their functional
target mRNAs. Resected lung from patients with COPD undergoing lung cancer
surgery was profiled using miRNA (Agilent Human miRNA profiler G4470 V1.01) and
mRNA (OperonV2.0) microarrays. Cells of lung origin (BEAS-2B and HFL1) were
profiled using mRNA microarrays (Illumina HumanHT-12 V3) after in vitro
manipulation.
RESULTS: COPD patients had mean (SD) age 68 (6) years, FEV1 72 (17)% predicted
and gas transfer (KCO) 70 (10)% predicted. Five miRNAs (miR-34c, miR-34b,
miR-149, miR-133a and miR-133b) were significantly down-regulated in lung from
patients with moderate compared to mild emphysema as defined by gas transfer (p <
0.01). In vitro upregulation of miR-34c in respiratory cells led to
down-regulation of predicted target mRNAs, including SERPINE1, MAP4K4, ZNF3,
ALDOA and HNF4A. The fold change in ex-vivo expression of all five predicted
target genes inversely correlated with that of miR-34c in emphysematous lung, but
this relationship was strongest for SERPINE1 (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Differences in miRNA expression are associated with emphysema
severity in COPD patients. MiR-34c modulates expression of its putative target
gene, SERPINE1, in vitro in respiratory cell lines and ex vivo in emphysematous
lung tissue.

Antioxidants are widely used to protect cells from damage induced by reactive
oxygen species (ROS). The concept that antioxidants can help fight cancer is
deeply rooted in the general population, promoted by the food supplement
industry, and supported by some scientific studies. However, clinical trials have
reported inconsistent results. We show that supplementing the diet with the
antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and vitamin E markedly increases tumor
progression and reduces survival in mouse models of B-RAF- and K-RAS-induced lung
cancer. RNA sequencing revealed that NAC and vitamin E, which are structurally
unrelated, produce highly coordinated changes in tumor transcriptome profiles,
dominated by reduced expression of endogenous antioxidant genes. NAC and vitamin 
E increase tumor cell proliferation by reducing ROS, DNA damage, and p53
expression in mouse and human lung tumor cells. Inactivation of p53 increases
tumor growth to a similar degree as antioxidants and abolishes the antioxidant
effect. Thus, antioxidants accelerate tumor growth by disrupting the ROS-p53
axis. Because somatic mutations in p53 occur late in tumor progression,
antioxidants may accelerate the growth of early tumors or precancerous lesions in
high-risk populations such as smokers and patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease who receive NAC to relieve mucus production.

Smoking and COPD are associated with decreased mucociliary clearance, and healthy
smokers have shorter cilia in the large airway than nonsmokers. We hypothesized
that changes in cilia length are consistent throughout the airway, and we further
hypothesized that smokers with COPD have shorter cilia than healthy smokers.
Because intraflagellar transport (IFT) is the process by which cilia of normal
length are produced and maintained, and alterations in IFT lead to short cilia in
model organisms, we also hypothesized that smoking induces changes in the
expression of IFT-related genes in the airway epithelium of smokers and smokers
with COPD. To assess these hypotheses, airway epithelium was obtained via
bronchoscopic brushing. Cilia length was assessed by measuring 100 cilia (10
cilia on each of 10 cells) per subject and Affymetrix microarrays were used to
evaluate IFT gene expression in nonsmokers and healthy smokers in 2 independent
data sets from large and small airway as well as in COPD smokers in a data set
from the small airway. In the large and small airway epithelium, cilia were
significantly shorter in healthy smokers than nonsmokers, and significantly
shorter in COPD smokers than in both healthy smokers and nonsmokers. The gene
expression data confirmed that a set of 8 IFT genes were down-regulated in
smokers in both data sets; however, no differences were seen in COPD smokers
compared to healthy smokers. These results support the concept that loss of cilia
length contributes to defective mucociliary clearance in COPD, and that
smoking-induced changes in expression of IFT genes may be one mechanism of
abnormally short cilia in smokers. Strategies to normalize cilia length may be an
important avenue for novel COPD therapies.

RATIONALE: Goblet cell metaplasia accompanies common pulmonary disorders that are
prone to recurrent viral infections. Mechanisms regulating both goblet cell
metaplasia and susceptibility to viral infection associated with chronic lung
diseases are incompletely understood.
OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the role of the transcription factor FOXA3 in
regulation of goblet cell metaplasia and pulmonary innate immunity.
METHODS: FOXA3 was identified in airways from patients with asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. We produced transgenic mice conditionally
expressing Foxa3 in airway epithelial cells and developed human bronchial
epithelial cells expressing Foxa3. Foxa3-regulated genes were identified by
immunostaining, Western blotting, and RNA analysis. Direct binding of FOXA3 to
target genes was identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
correlated with RNA sequencing.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: FOXA3 was highly expressed in airway goblet cells 
from patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. FOXA3 was
induced by either IL-13 or rhinovirus. Foxa3 induced goblet cell metaplasia and
enhanced expression of a network of genes mediating mucus production.
Paradoxically, FOXA3 inhibited rhinovirus-induced IFN production, IRF-3
phosphorylation, and IKKε expression and inhibited viral clearance and expression
of genes required for antiviral defenses, including MDA5, RIG-I, TLR3, IRF7/9,
and nuclear factor-κB.
CONCLUSIONS: FOXA3 induces goblet cell metaplasia in response to infection or Th2
stimulation. Suppression of IFN signaling by FOXA3 provides a plausible mechanism
that may serve to limit ongoing Th1 inflammation during the resolution of acute
viral infection; however, inhibition of innate immunity by FOXA3 may contribute
to susceptibility to viral infections associated with chronic lung disorders
accompanied by chronic goblet cell metaplasia.

MOTIVATION: After more than a decade since microarrays were used to predict
phenotype of biological samples, real-life applications for disease screening and
identification of patients who would best benefit from treatment are still
emerging. The interest of the scientific community in identifying best approaches
to develop such prediction models was reaffirmed in a competition style
international collaboration called IMPROVER Diagnostic Signature Challenge whose 
results we describe herein.
RESULTS: Fifty-four teams used public data to develop prediction models in four
disease areas including multiple sclerosis, lung cancer, psoriasis and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and made predictions on blinded new data that we
generated. Teams were scored using three metrics that captured various aspects of
the quality of predictions, and best performers were awarded. This article
presents the challenge results and introduces to the community the approaches of 
the best overall three performers, as well as an R package that implements the
approach of the best overall team. The analyses of model performance data
submitted in the challenge as well as additional simulations that we have
performed revealed that (i) the quality of predictions depends more on the
disease endpoint than on the particular approaches used in the challenge; (ii)
the most important modeling factor (e.g. data preprocessing, feature selection
and classifier type) is problem dependent; and (iii) for optimal results datasets
and methods have to be carefully matched. Biomedical factors such as the disease 
severity and confidence in diagnostic were found to be associated with the
misclassification rates across the different teams.
AVAILABILITY: The lung cancer dataset is available from Gene Expression Omnibus
(accession, GSE43580). The maPredictDSC R package implementing the approach of
the best overall team is available at www.bioconductor.org or
http://bioinformaticsprb.med.wayne.edu/.

CXCL14, a recently described epithelial cytokine, plays putative multiple roles
in inflammation and carcinogenesis. In the context that chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer are both smoking-related disorders
associated with airway epithelial disorder and inflammation, we hypothesized that
the airway epithelium responds to cigarette smoking with altered CXCL14 gene
expression, contributing to the disease-relevant phenotype. Using genome-wide
microarrays with subsequent immunohistochemical analysis, the data demonstrate
that the expression of CXCL14 is up-regulated in the airway epithelium of healthy
smokers and further increased in COPD smokers, especially within
hyperplastic/metaplastic lesions, in association with multiple genes relevant to 
epithelial structural integrity and cancer. In vitro experiments revealed that
the expression of CXCL14 is induced in the differentiated airway epithelium by
cigarette smoke extract, and that epidermal growth factor mediates CXCL14
up-regulation in the airway epithelium through its effects on the basal
stem/progenitor cell population. Analyses of two independent lung cancer cohorts 
revealed a dramatic up-regulation of CXCL14 expression in adenocarcinoma and
squamous-cell carcinoma. High expression of the COPD-associated
CXCL14-correlating cluster of genes was linked in lung adenocarcinoma with poor
survival. These data suggest that the smoking-induced expression of CXCL14 in the
airway epithelium represents a novel potential molecular link between
smoking-associated airway epithelial injury, COPD, and lung cancer.

Although most cases of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occur in
smokers, only a fraction of smokers develop the disease. We hypothesized distinct
molecular signatures for COPD and emphysema in the peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMCs) of current and former smokers. To test this hypothesis, we
identified and validated PBMC gene expression profiles in smokers with and
without COPD. We generated expression data on 136 subjects from the COPDGene
study, using Affymetrix U133 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA).
Multiple linear regression with adjustment for covariates (gender, age, body mass
index, family history, smoking status, and pack-years) was used to identify
candidate genes, and ingenuity pathway analysis was used to identify candidate
pathways. Candidate genes were validated in 149 subjects according to multiplex
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, which included 75 subjects not 
previously profiled. Pathways that were differentially expressed in subjects with
COPD and emphysema included those that play a role in the immune system,
inflammatory responses, and sphingolipid (ceramide) metabolism. Twenty-six of the
46 candidate genes (e.g., FOXP1, TCF7, and ASAH1) were validated in the
independent cohort. Plasma metabolomics was used to identify a novel
glycoceramide (galabiosylceramide) as a biomarker of emphysema, supporting the
genomic association between acid ceramidase (ASAH1) and emphysema. COPD is a
systemic disease whose gene expression signatures in PBMCs could serve as novel
diagnostic or therapeutic targets.

RNU2 exists in two functional forms (RNU2-1 and RNU2-2) distinguishable by the
presence of a unique 4-bases motif. Detailed investigation of datasets obtained
from deep sequencing of five human lung primary tumors revealed that both forms
express at a high rate a 19-22nt fragment (miR-U2-1 and -2) from its 3' region
and contains the 4-bases motif. Deep sequencing of independent pools of serum
samples from healthy donors and lung cancer patients revealed that miR-U2-1 and
-2 are pervasively processed in lung tissue by means of endonucleolytic cleavages
and stably exported to the blood. Then, microarrays hybridization experiments of 
matched normal/tumor samples revealed a significant over-expression of miR-U2-1
in 14 of 18 lung primary tumors. Subsequently, qRT-PCR of miR-U2-1 using serum
from 62 lung cancer patients and 96 various controls demonstrated that its
expression levels identify lung cancer patients with 79% sensitivity and 80%
specificity. miR-U2-1 expression correlated with the presence or absence of lung 
cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), other
diseases of the lung - not cancer, and in healthy controls. These data suggest
that RNU2-1 is a new bi-functional ncRNA that produces a 19-22nt fragment which
may be useful in detecting lung cancer non-invasively in high risk patients.

Tobacco smoke consists of thousands of harmful components. A major class of
chemicals found in tobacco smoke is formed by aldehydes, in particular
formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein. The present study investigates the gene 
expression changes in human lung alveolar epithelial cells upon exposure to
formaldehyde, acrolein and acetaldehyde at sub-cytotoxic levels. We exposed A549 
cells in vitro to aldehydes and non-aldehyde chemicals (nicotine, hydroquinone
and 2,5-dimethylfuran) present in tobacco smoke and used microarrays to obtain a 
global view of the transcriptomic responses. We compared responses of the
individual aldehydes with that of the non-aldehydes. We also studied the response
of the aldehydes when present in a mixture at relative concentrations as present 
in cigarette smoke. Formaldehyde gave the strongest response; a total of 66 genes
were more than 1.5-fold differentially expressed mostly involved in apoptosis and
DNA damage related processes, followed by acetaldehyde (57 genes), hydroquinone
(55 genes) and nicotine (8 genes). For acrolein and the mixture only one gene was
upregulated involved in oxidative stress. No gene expression effect was found for
exposure to 2,5-dimethylfuran. Overall, aldehyde responses are primarily
indicative for genotoxicity and oxidative stress. These two toxicity mechanisms
are linked to respiratory diseases such as cancer and COPD, respectively. The
present findings could be important in providing further understanding of the
role of aldehydes emitted from cigarette smoke in the onset of pulmonary
diseases.

Xiaoqinglong decoction (XQLD) has been used for centuries in Asia to effectively 
treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, its
mechanisms remain unknown. To elucidate this problem, we analyzed the effects of 
XQLD on gene expressions profiles in COPD rats. In the study, 20 male Wistar rats
were injected with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), exposed to cigarette smoke and kept 
at -20°C for 5 min/day for a successive 8 days to establish COPD animals. Trachea
ultramicrostructure and histomorphology were observed to determine whether these 
models were established successfully. Gene expression profiles were detected
using cDNA microarrays. We found 56 differentially expressed genes associated
with COPD progression, including 32 up-regulated genes and 24 down-regulated
genes. These genes were confirmed to be involved in immune and inflammation
reactions, metabolism, cell transportation and the cell cycle, signal
transduction and gene regulation. Comparison of gene expression between the
therapy group and control group showed that there were only 11 differentially
expressed genes, including 5 up-regulated genes and 6 down-regulated genes. We
concluded that XQLD had therapeutic effects in COPD rats by affecting gene
expression. Pharmacological or targeted expression of some genes might be found
useful as novel therapy in COPD management.

smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

The TLRs are important components of the respiratory epithelium host innate
defense, enabling the airway surface to recognize and respond to a variety of
insults in inhaled air. On the basis of the knowledge that smokers are more
susceptible to pulmonary infection and that the airway epithelium of smokers with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by bacterial
colonization and acute exacerbation of airway infections, we assessed whether
smoking alters expression of TLRs in human small airway epithelium, the primary
site of smoking-induced disease. Microarrays were used to survey the TLR family
gene expression in small airway (10th to 12th order) epithelium from healthy
nonsmokers (n = 60), healthy smokers (n = 73), and smokers with COPD (n = 36).
Using the criteria of detection call of present (P call) ≥ 50%, 6 of 10 TLRs
(TLRs 1-5 and 8) were expressed. Compared with nonsmokers, the most striking
change was for TLR5, which was downregulated in healthy smokers (1.4-fold, p <
10⁻¹⁰) and smokers with COPD (1.6-fold, p < 10⁻¹¹). TaqMan RT-PCR confirmed these
observations. Bronchial biopsy immunofluorescence studies showed that TLR5 was
expressed mainly on the apical side of the epithelium and was decreased in
healthy smokers and smokers with COPD. In vitro, the level of TLR5 downstream
genes, IL-6 and IL-8, was highly induced by flagellin in TLR5 high-expressing
cells compared with TLR5 low-expressing cells. In the context that TLR5 functions
to recognize pathogens and activate innate immune responses, the smoking-induced 
downregulation of TLR5 may contribute to smoking-related susceptibility to airway
infection, at least for flagellated bacteria.

MOTIVATION: Computational inference methods that make use of graphical models to 
extract regulatory networks from gene expression data can have difficulty
reconstructing dense regions of a network, a consequence of both computational
complexity and unreliable parameter estimation when sample size is small. As a
result, identification of hub genes is of special difficulty for these methods.
METHODS: We present a new algorithm, Empirical Light Mutual Min (ELMM), for large
network reconstruction that has properties well suited for recovery of graphs
with high-degree nodes. ELMM reconstructs the undirected graph of a regulatory
network using empirical Bayes conditional independence testing with a heuristic
relaxation of independence constraints in dense areas of the graph. This
relaxation allows only one gene of a pair with a putative relation to be aware of
the network connection, an approach that is aimed at easing multiple testing
problems associated with recovering densely connected structures.
RESULTS: Using in silico data, we show that ELMM has better performance than
commonly used network inference algorithms including GeneNet, ARACNE, FOCI,
GENIE3 and GLASSO. We also apply ELMM to reconstruct a network among 5492 genes
expressed in human lung airway epithelium of healthy non-smokers, healthy smokers
and individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease assayed using
microarrays. The analysis identifies dense sub-networks that are consistent with 
known regulatory relationships in the lung airway and also suggests novel hub
regulatory relationships among a number of genes that play roles in oxidative
stress and secretion.

smokers and non-smokers.

BACKGROUND: Mucus hypersecretion contributes to the morbidity and mortality of
smoking-related lung diseases, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), which starts in the small airways. Despite progress in animal studies,
the genes and their expression pattern involved in mucus production and secretion
in human airway epithelium are not well understood. We hypothesized that
comparison of the transcriptomes of the small airway epithelium of individuals
that express high vs low levels of MUC5AC, the major macromolecular component of 
airway mucus, could be used as a probe to identify the genes related to human
small airway mucus production/secretion.
METHODS: Flexible bronchoscopy and brushing were used to obtain small airway
epithelium (10th to 12th order bronchi) from healthy nonsmokers (n=60) and
healthy smokers (n=72). Affymetrix HG-U133 plus 2.0 microarrays were used to
assess gene expression. Massive parallel sequencing (RNA-Seq) was used to verify 
gene expression of small airway epithelium from 5 nonsmokers and 6 smokers.
RESULTS: MUC5AC expression varied 31-fold among the healthy nonsmokers.
Genome-wide comparison between healthy nonsmokers (n = 60) grouped as "high
MUC5AC expressors" vs "low MUC5AC expressors" identified 528 genes significantly 
up-regulated and 15 genes significantly down-regulated in the high vs low
expressors. This strategy identified both mucus production and secretion related 
genes under control of a network composed of multiple transcription factors.
Based on the literature, genes in the up-regulated list were used to identify a
73 "MUC5AC-associated core gene" list with 9 categories: mucus component;
mucus-producing cell differentiation-related transcription factor;
mucus-producing cell differentiation-related pathway or mediator;
post-translational modification of mucin; vesicle transport; endoplasmic
reticulum stress-related; secretory granule-associated; mucus secretion-related
regulator and mucus hypersecretory-related ion channel. As a validation cohort,
we assessed the MUC5AC-associated core gene list in the small airway epithelium
of an independent set of healthy smokers (n = 72). There was up-regulation of
MUC5AC in the small airway epithelium of smokers (2.3-fold, p < 10-8) associated 
with a coordinated up-regulation of MUC5AC-associated core gene expression
pattern in the small airway epithelium of smokers (p < 0.01). Deep sequencing
confirmed these observations.
CONCLUSION: The identification of the genes associated with increased airway
mucin production in humans should be useful in understanding the pathogenesis of 
airway mucus hypersecretion and identifying therapeutic targets. AUTHOR SUMMARY: 
Mucus hypersecretion contributes to the morbidity and mortality of
smoking-related lung diseases, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), which starts in the small airways. Little is known about the gene
networks associated with the synthesis and secretion of mucins in the human small
airway epithelium. Taking advantage of the knowledge that MUC5AC is a major mucin
secreted by the small airway epithelium, the expression of MUC5AC in small airway
epithelium is highly regulated at the transcriptional level and our observation
that healthy nonsmokers have variable numbers of MUC5AC+ secretory cells in the
human small airway epithelium, we compared genome-wide gene expression of the
small airway epithelium of high vs low MUC5AC expressors from 60 nonsmokers to
identify the genes associated with MUC5AC expression. This novel strategy enabled
identification of a 73 "MUC5AC-associated core gene" list with 9 categories,
which control a series of processes from mucin biosynthesis to mucus secretion.
The coordinated gene expression pattern of MUC5AC-associated core genes were
corroborated in an independent cohort of 72 healthy smokers. Deep sequencing of
small airway epithelium RNA confirmed these observations. This finding will be
useful in identifying therapeutic targets to treat small airway mucus
hypersecretion.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is influenced by
environmental and genetic factors. An important fraction of COPD cases harbor a
major genetic determinant, inherited ZZ (Glu342Lys) α1-antitrypsin deficiency
(AATD). A study was undertaken to investigate gene expression patterns in
end-stage COPD lungs from patients with and without AATD.
METHODS: Explanted lungs of end-stage ZZ AATD-related (treated and non-treated
with AAT augmentation therapy) and "normal" MM COPD, and liver biopsies from
patients suffering from liver cirrhosis with and without ZZ AATD were used for
gene expression analysis by Affymetrix microarrays or RT-PCR.
RESULTS: A total of 162 genes were found to be differentially expressed
(p-value ≤ 0.05 and |FC| ≥ 2) between MM and ZZ COPD patients. Of those, 134 gene
sets were up-regulated and 28 were down-regulated in ZZ relative to MM lung
tissue. A subgroup of genes, zinc finger protein 165, snail homolog 1
(Drosophila) (SNAI1), and Krüppel-like transcription factors (KLFs) 4 (gut), 9
and 10, perfectly segregated ZZ and MM COPD patients. The higher expression of
KLF 9 and KLF10 has been verified in the replication cohort with AATD-related
end-stage lung emphysema and liver cirrhosis. Furthermore, higher expression of
KLF9, SNAI1 and DEFA1 was found in ZZ COPD lungs without augmentation therapy
relative to MM COPD or ZZ COPD with augmentation therapy.
CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal the involvement of transcriptional regulators
of the zinc-finger family in COPD pathogenesis and provide deeper insight into
the pathophysiological mechanisms of COPD with and without AATD.

AIMS: Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogenesis of many
inflammatory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They 
can alter the expression of genes involved in cellular damage by activating
transcription factors, including the NF-κB and the activator protein 1 (AP-1).
Phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitors have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
effects, as described in in vivo and in vitro COPD models. This study analysed
the effects of piclamilast, a selective PDE4 inhibitor, on modulating the global 
gene expression profile in A549 cells exposed to H(2)O(2).
MAIN METHODS: Changes in gene expression were analysed using high-density
Affymetrix microarrays and validated by RT-PCR. Cell proliferation was studied
using BrdU incorporation. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using annexin 
V-fluorescein isothiocyanate. C-Jun phosphorylation and AP-1 activation were
determined by ELISA and luciferase assay, respectively.
KEY FINDINGS: Our results indicate that H(2)O(2) modified the expression of
several genes related to apoptosis, cell cycle control and cell signalling,
including IL8, FAS, HIG2, CXCL2, CDKN25 and JUNB. Piclamilast pre-treatment
significantly inhibited the changes in 23 genes via mechanisms involving AP-1
activation and c-Jun phosphorylation at Ser63. Functional experiments confirmed
our results, suggesting new targets related to the antioxidant properties of PDE4
inhibitors.
SIGNIFICANCE: This is the first study to demonstrate antioxidant effects of a
selective PDE4 inhibitor at the global gene expression level, and the results
support the importance of AP-1 as a key regulator of the expression of genes
involved in the inflammatory response of epithelial cells to oxidative damage.

The role of viruses in Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (AECOPD) needs further elucidation. The aim of the present study was to
evaluate the molecular epidemiology of viral pathogens in AECOPD. Patients
presenting to the Emergency Room with AECOPD needing hospitalization were
recruited. Oropharyngeal and sputum samples were collected in order to perform
microarrays-based viral testing for the detection of respiratory viruses. A total
of 200 (100%) patients were analyzed and from them in 107 (53.5%) a virus was
detected. The commonest identified viruses were the human Respiratory Syncytial
Virus (subtypes A and B) (40.5%), influenza virus (subtypes A, B, C) (11%),
rhinovirus (8%) and human Parainfluenza Virus (subtypes A and B) (7.5%). A
bacterial pathogen was isolated in 27 (14%) patients and a dual infection due to 
a bacterial and a viral pathogen was recognised in 14/107 patients. Patients with
AECOPD and a viral infection had a lengthier hospital stay (9.2 ± 4.6 vs
7.6 ± 4.3, p < 0.01) while the severity of the disease was no related with
significant differences among the groups of the study population. In conclusion, 
the isolation of a virus was strongly associated with AECOPD in the examined
population. The stage of COPD appeared to have no relation with the frequency of 
the isolated viruses while dual infection with a viral and a bacterial pathogen
was not rare.

To identify non-invasive gene expression markers for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), we performed genome-wide expression profiling of
peripheral blood samples from 12 subjects with significant airflow obstruction
and an equal number of non-obstructed controls. RNA was isolated from Peripheral 
Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) and gene expression was assessed using Affymetrix
U133 Plus 2.0 arrays.Tests for gene expression changes that discriminate between 
COPD cases (FEV1< 70% predicted, FEV1/FVC < 0.7) and controls (FEV1> 80%
predicted, FEV1/FVC > 0.7) were performed using Significance Analysis of
Microarrays (SAM) and Bayesian Analysis of Differential Gene Expression (BADGE). 
Using either test at high stringency (SAM median FDR = 0 or BADGE p < 0.01) we
identified differential expression for 45 known genes. Correlation of gene
expression with lung function measurements (FEV1 & FEV1/FVC), using both Pearson 
and Spearman correlation coefficients (p < 0.05), identified a set of 86 genes. A
total of 16 markers showed evidence of significant correlation (p < 0.05) with
quantitative traits and differential expression between cases and controls. We
further compared our peripheral gene expression markers with those we previously 
identified from lung tissue of the same cohort. Two genes, RP9and NAPE-PLD, were 
identified as decreased in COPD cases compared to controls in both lung tissue
and blood. These results contribute to our understanding of gene expression
changes in the peripheral blood of patients with COPD and may provide insight
into potential mechanisms involved in the disease.

The advent of RNA sequencing technology has stimulated rapid advances in our
understanding of the transcriptome, including discovery of the vast RNA
complement generated by transcript splice variation and the expansion of our
knowledge of non-coding RNAs. One non-coding RNA subtype, microRNAs (miRNAs), are
particularly well studied, primarily because of their important roles as
post-transcriptional gene regulators. The first miRNA was identified in the early
1990s and there are now thought to be around 1000 distinct miRNAs in man, with
each cell type expressing a distinct repertoire. Increasing evidence has

Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of
America.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema develops in 15%
of ex-smokers despite sustained quitting, while 10% are free of emphysema or
severe lung obstruction. The cause of the incapacity of the immune system to
clear the inflammation in the first group remains unclear.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched genes that were protecting ex-smokers without
emphysema, using microarrays on portions of human lungs surgically removed; we
found that loss of lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and emphysema was associated with a lower expression of CD46 and verified
this finding by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Also, there was a significant
association among decreased CD46(+) cells with decreased CD4(+)T cells, apoptosis
mediator CD95 and increased CD8(+)T cells that were protecting patients without
emphysema or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. CD46 not only
regulates the production of T regulatory cells, which suppresses CD8(+)T cell
proliferation, but also the complement cascade by degradation of C3b. These
results were replicated in the murine smoking model, which showed increased C5a
(produced by C3b) that suppressed IL12 mediated bias to T helper 1 cells and
elastin co-precipitation with C3b, suggesting that elastin could be presented as 
an antigen. Thus, using ELISA from elastin peptides, we verified that 43% of the 
patients with severe early onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tested 
positive for IgG to elastin in their serum compared to healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that higher expression of CD46 in the lungs of
ex-smoker protects them from emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
by clearing the inflammation impeding the proliferation of CD8(+) T cells and
necrosis, achieved by production of T regulatory cells and degradation of C3b;
restraining the complement cascade favors apoptosis over necrosis, protecting
them from autoimmunity and chronic inflammation.

Transcriptomic studies of the airway field of injury associated with
smoking-related lung disease.

The "field of injury" hypothesis proposes that exposure to an inhaled insult such
as cigarette smoke elicits a common molecular response throughout the respiratory
tract. This response can therefore be quantified in any airway tissue, including 
readily accessible epithelial cells in the bronchus, nose, and mouth.
High-throughput technologies, such as whole-genome gene expression microarrays,
can be employed to catalog the physiological consequences of such exposures in
the airway epithelium. Pulmonary diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, lung cancer, and asthma are also thought to be associated with a field
of injury, and in patients with these diseases, airway epithelial cells can be a 
useful surrogate for diseased tissue that is often difficult to obtain. Global
measurement of mRNA and microRNA expression in these cells can provide useful
information about the molecular pathogenesis of such diseases and may be useful
for diagnosis and for predicting prognosis and response to therapy. In this
review, our aim is to summarize the history and state of the art of such
"transcriptomic" studies in the human airway epithelium, especially in smoking
and smoking-related lung diseases, and to highlight future directions for this
field.

Down-regulation of the canonical Wnt β-catenin pathway in the airway epithelium
of healthy smokers and smokers with COPD.

Author information:

York, United States of America.

BACKGROUND: The Wnt pathway mediates differentiation of epithelial tissues;
depending on the tissue types, Wnt can either drive or inhibit the
differentiation process. We hypothesized that key genes in the Wnt pathway are
suppressed in the human airway epithelium under the stress of cigarette smoking, 
a stress associated with dysregulation of the epithelial differentiated state.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Microarrays were used to assess the expression of
Wnt-related genes in the small airway epithelium (SAE) obtained via bronchoscopy 
and brushing of healthy nonsmokers, healthy smokers, and smokers with COPD.
Thirty-three of 56 known Wnt-related genes were expressed in the SAE. Wnt pathway
downstream mediators β-catenin and the transcription factor 7-like 1 were
down-regulated in healthy smokers and smokers with COPD, as were many Wnt target 
genes. Among the extracellular regulators that suppress the Wnt pathway, secreted
frizzled-related protein 2 (SFRP2), was up-regulated 4.3-fold in healthy smokers 
and 4.9-fold in COPD smokers, an observation confirmed by TaqMan Real-time PCR,
Western analysis and immunohistochemistry. Finally, cigarette smoke extract
mediated up-regulation of SFRP2 and down-regulation of Wnt target genes in airway
epithelial cells in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Smoking down-regulates the Wnt pathway in the human
airway epithelium. In the context that Wnt pathway plays an important role in
differentiation of epithelial tissues, the down-regulation of Wnt pathway may
contribute to the dysregulation of airway epithelium differentiation observed in 
smoking-related airway disorders.

BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an inflammatory lung 
disease with associated systemic effects.
OBJECTIVE: To use gene expression microarrays in peripheral blood leukocytes of
current and former cigarette smokers to identify differences associated with
COPD.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Random forest modelling and a split-sample case-control
approach were used to identify candidate predictors.
RESULTS: We identified 1013 genes and one smoking exposure variable that
differentiated current and former smokers with or without COPD. This predictor
set was reduced to a nine-gene classifier (IL6R, CCR2, PPP2CB, RASSF2, WTAP,
DNTTIP2, GDAP1, LIPE and RPL14).
CONCLUSION: These gene expression profiles represent potential biomarkers for
COPD and may help increase mechanistic understanding of the disease.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death
worldwide and is influenced by both genetic determinants and smoking. We
identified genomic regions from 56 lung-tissue gene-expression microarrays and
used them to select 889 SNPs to be tested for association with COPD. We genotyped
SNPs in 389 severe COPD cases from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial and 424
cigarette-smoking controls from the Normative Aging Study. A total of 71
autosomal SNPs demonstrated at least nominal significance with COPD
susceptibility (p = 3.4 x 10(-6) to 0.05). These 71 SNPs were evaluated in a
family-based study of 127 probands with severe, early-onset COPD and 822 of their
family members in the Boston Early-Onset COPD Study. We combined p values from
the case-control and family-based analyses, setting p = 5.60 x 10(-5) as a
conservative threshold for significance. Three SNPs in the iron regulatory
protein 2 (IREB2) gene met this stringent threshold for significance, and four
other IREB2 SNPs demonstrated combined p < 0.02. We demonstrated replication of
association for these seven IREB2 SNPs (all p values < or = 0.02) in a
family-based study of 3117 subjects from the International COPD Genetics Network;
combined p values across all cohorts for the main phenotype of interest ranged
from 1.6 x 10(-7) to 6.4 x 10(-4). IREB2 protein and mRNA were increased in
lung-tissue samples from COPD subjects in comparison to controls. In summary,
gene-expression and genetic-association results have implicated IREB2 as a COPD
susceptibility gene.

High-throughput, genome-wide analytical technologies are now commonly used in all
fields of medical research. The most commonly applied of these technologies, gene
expression microarrays, have been shown to be both accurate and precise when
properly implemented. For over a decade, microarrays have provided novel insight 
into many complex human diseases. Microarray-based discovery can be classified
into three components, biomarker detection, disease (sub)classification and
identification of causal mechanism, in order of accomplishment. Within the
respiratory system, the application of microarrays has achieved significant
success in all components, particularly with respect to lung cancer. Numerous
studies over the last half-decade have applied this technology to the
characterization of non-malignant respiratory diseases, animal models of
respiratory disease and normal developmental processes. Studies of obstructive
lung diseases by many groups, including our own, have yielded not only disease
biomarkers, but also some novel putative pathogenic mechanisms. We have
successfully used an integrative genomics approach, combining microarray analysis
with human genetics, to identify susceptibility genes for COPD (chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease). Interestingly, we find that the assessment of
quantitative phenotypic variables enhances gene discovery. Our studies contribute
to the identification of obstructive lung disease biomarkers, provide data
associated with disease phenotypes and support the use of an integrated approach 
to move beyond marker identification to mechanism discovery.

Antibody microarrays have emerged as useful tools for high-throughput protein
analysis and candidate biomarker screening. We describe here the development of a
multiplexed microsphere-based antibody array capable of simultaneously measuring 
10 inflammatory protein mediators. Cytokine-capture microspheres were fabricated 
by covalently coupling monoclonal antibodies specific for cytokines of interest
to fluorescently encoded 3.1 microm polymer microspheres. An optical fiber bundle
containing approximately 50,000 individual 3.1 microm diameter fibers was
chemically etched to create microwells in which cytokine-capture microspheres
could be deposited. Microspheres were randomly distributed in the wells to
produce an antibody array for performing a multiplexed sandwich immunoassay. The 
array responded specifically to recombinant cytokine solutions in a
concentration-dependent fashion. The array was also used to examine endogenous
mediator patterns in saliva supernatants from patients with pulmonary
inflammatory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). This array technology may prove useful as a laboratory-based platform for
inflammatory disease research and diagnostics, and its small footprint could also
enable integration into a microfluidic cassette for use in point-of-care testing.

Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

Despite the status of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a major
global health problem, no currently available therapies can limit COPD
progression. Therefore, an urgent need exists for the development of new and
effective treatments for COPD. An improved understanding in the molecular
pathogenesis of COPD can potentially identify molecular targets to facilitate the
development of new therapeutic modalities. Among the best approaches for
understanding the molecular basis of COPD include gene expression profiling
techniques, such as serial analysis of gene expression or microarrays. Using
these methods, recent studies have mapped comparative gene expression profiles of
lung tissues from patients with different stages of COPD relative to healthy
smokers or non-smokers. Such studies have revealed a number of
differentially-regulated genes associated with COPD progression, which include
genes involved in the regulation of inflammation, extracellular matrix,
cytokines, chemokines, apoptosis, and stress responses. These studies have shed
new light on the molecular mechanisms of COPD, and suggest novel targets for
clinical treatments.

Decreased expression of intelectin 1 in the human airway epithelium of smokers
compared to nonsmokers.

Lectins are innate immune defense proteins that recognize bacterial cell wall
components. Based on the knowledge that cigarette smoking is associated with an
increased risk of infections, we hypothesized that cigarette smoking may modulate
the expression of lectin genes in airway epithelium. Affymetrix microarrays were 
used to survey the expression of lectin genes in large airway epithelium from
nine nonsmokers and 20 healthy smokers and in small airway epithelium from 13
nonsmokers and 20 healthy smokers. There were no changes (>2-fold change; p <
0.05) in lectin gene expression among healthy smokers compared with nonsmokers
except for down-regulation of intelectin 1, a lectin that binds to
galactofuranosyl residues in bacterial cell walls (large airway epithelium, p <
0.01; small airway epithelium, p < 0.01). This was confirmed by TaqMan RT-PCR in 
both large (p < 0.05) and small airway epithelium (p < 0.02).
Immunohistochemistry assessment of airway biopsies demonstrated that intelectin 1
was expressed in secretory cells, while Western analysis confirmed the decreased 
expression of intelectin 1 in airway epithelium of healthy smokers compared with 
healthy nonsmokers (p < 0.02). Finally, compared with healthy nonsmokers,
intelectin 1 expression was also decreased in small airway epithelium of smokers 
with lone emphysema and normal spirometry (n = 13, p < 0.01) and smokers with
established chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 14, p < 0.01). In the
context that intelectin 1 plays a role in defense against bacteria, its
down-regulation in response to cigarette smoking is another example of the
immunomodulatory effects of smoking on the immune system and may contribute to
the increase in susceptibility to infections observed in smokers.

Although a hereditary contribution to emphysema has been long suspected, severe
alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency remains the only conclusively proven genetic risk
factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Recently, genome-wide
linkage analysis has led to the identification of two promising candidate genes
for COPD: TGFB1 and SERPINE2. Like multiple other COPD candidate gene
associations, even these positionally identified genes have not been universally 
replicated across all studies. Differences in phenotype definition may contribute
to nonreplication in genetic studies of heterogeneous disorders such as COPD. The
use of precisely measured phenotypes, including emphysema quantification on
high-resolution chest computed tomography scans, has aided in the discovery of
additional genes for clinically relevant COPD-related traits. The use of computed
tomography scans to assess emphysema and airway disease as well as newer genetic 
technologies, including gene expression microarrays and genome-wide association
studies, has great potential to detect novel genes affecting COPD susceptibility,
severity, and response to treatment.

Optical fiber microarrays have been used to screen saliva from patients with
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) to ascertain the efficacy of dialysis. We have
successfully identified markers in saliva that correlate with kidney disease.
Standard assay chemistries for these markers have been converted to disposable
test strips such that patients may one day be able to monitor their clinical
status at home. Details of these developments are described. In addition, saliva 
from asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients is being
screened for useful diagnostic markers. Our goal is to develop a multiplexed
assay for these protein and nucleic acid biomarkers for diagnosing the cause and 
severity of pulmonary exacerbations, enabling more effective treatment to be
administered. These results are reported in the second part of this article.

Gene expression profiling of human alveolar macrophages of phenotypically normal

Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of the respiratory diseases collectively
known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While the pathogenesis of 
COPD is complex, there is abundant evidence that alveolar macrophages (AM) play
an important role. Based on the concept that COPD is a slow-progressing disorder 
likely involving multiple mediators released by AM activated by cigarette smoke, 
the present study focuses on the identification of previously unrecognized genes 
that may be linked to early events in the molecular pathogenesis of COPD, as
opposed to factors associated with the presence of disease. To accomplish this,
microarray analysis using Affymetrix microarrays was used to carry out an
unbiased survey of the differences in gene expression profiles in the AM of
phenotypically normal, approximately 20 pack-year smokers compared to healthy
nonsmokers. Although smoking did not alter the global gene expression pattern of 
AM, 75 genes were modulated by smoking, with 40 genes up-regulated and 35
down-regulated in the AM of smokers compared to nonsmokers. Most of these genes
belong to the functional categories of immune/inflammatory response, cell
adhesion and extracellular matrix, proteolysis and antiproteolysis, lysosomal
function, antioxidant-related function, signal transduction, and regulation of
transcription. Of these 75 genes, 69 have not been previously recognized to be
up- or down-regulated in AM in association with smoking or COPD, including genes 
coding for proteins belonging to all of the above categories, and others
belonging to various functional categories or of unknown function. These
observations suggest that gene expression responses of AM associated with the
stress of cigarette smoking are more complex than previously thought, and offer a
variety of new insights into the complex pathogenesis of smoking-induced lung
diseases.

Lung fibroblasts from patients with emphysema show markers of senescence in
vitro.

BACKGROUND: The loss of alveolar walls is a hallmark of emphysema. As fibroblasts
play an important role in the maintenance of alveolar structure, a change in
fibroblast phenotype could be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. In a 
previous study we found a reduced in vitro proliferation rate and number of
population doublings of parenchymal lung fibroblasts from patients with emphysema
and we hypothesized that these findings could be related to a premature cellular 
aging of these cells. In this study, we therefore compared cellular senescence
markers and expression of respective genes between lung fibroblasts from patients
with emphysema and control patients without COPD.
METHODS: Primary lung fibroblasts were obtained from 13 patients with moderate to
severe lung emphysema (E) and 15 controls (C) undergoing surgery for lung tumor
resection or volume reduction (n = 2). Fibroblasts (8E/9C) were stained for
senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal). In independent cultures, 
DNA from lung fibroblasts (7E/8C) was assessed for mean telomere length. Two
exploratory 12 k cDNA microarrays were used to assess gene expression in pooled
fibroblasts (3E/3C). Subsequently, expression of selected genes was evaluated by 
quantitative PCR (qPCR) in fibroblasts of individual patients (10E/9C) and
protein concentration was analyzed in the cell culture supernatant.
RESULTS: The median (quartiles) percentage of fibroblasts positive for
SA-beta-Gal was 4.4 (3.2;4.7) % in controls and 16.0 (10.0;24.8) % in emphysema
(p = 0.001), while telomere length was not different. Among the candidates for
differentially expressed genes in the array (factor > or = 3), 15 were
upregulated and 121 downregulated in emphysema. qPCR confirmed the upregulation
of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and IGFBP-rP1 (p = 0.029,
p = 0.0002), while expression of IGFBP-5, -rP2 (CTGF), -rP4 (Cyr61), FOSL1,
LOXL2, OAZ1 and CDK4 was not different between groups. In line with the gene
expression we found increased cell culture supernatant concentrations of IGFBP-3 
(p = 0.006) in emphysema.
CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that premature aging of lung
fibroblasts occurs in emphysema, via a telomere-independent mechanism. The
upregulation of the senescence-associated IGFBP-3 and -rP1 in emphysema suggests 
that inhibition of the action of insulin and insulin-like growth factors could be
involved in the reduced in vitro-proliferation rate.

Glucocorticoids attenuate the induction of numerous inflammatory mediators. We
hypothesized that a targeted screening for genes with these regulatory
characteristics, called glucocorticoid-attenuated response genes (GARGs), would
be an efficient way to identify genes participating in glucocorticoid-sensitive
inflammatory processes. An initial application of this idea, using an in vitro
model, identified 12 cDNAs induced by LPS and attenuated by dexamethasone,
including a new chemokine designated LIX. In vivo studies demonstrated that
endotoxemia-induced lung mRNA expression of LIX, but not of two related
chemokines, is markedly enhanced by adrenalectomy and attenuated by
dexamethasone. This work provided the basis for an in vivo screening project that
identified 36 GARG cDNAs induced in the lung during endotoxemia. The majority
represent genes of unknown function, or genes not previously implicated in the
pulmonary response to inflammation. Four encode previously undescribed proteins, 
including a chemokine, a member of a family of guanylate-binding proteins, a
2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein, and a novel lung-inducible
Neuralized-related C3HC4 RING protein (LINCR). Our results indicate that
glucocorticoid-attenuated response genes are much more diverse than originally
anticipated. Future studies using microarrays in this and other inflammation
models may identify many additional glucocorticoid-regulated genes potentially
important in inflammatory diseases.

The mechanism by which inhaled smoke causes the anatomic lesions and physiologic 
impairment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease remains unknown. We used
high-density microarrays to measure gene expression in severely emphysematous
lung tissue removed from smokers at lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) and
normal or mildly emphysematous lung tissue from smokers undergoing resection of
pulmonary nodules. Class prediction algorithms identified 102 genes that
accurately distinguished severe emphysema from non-/mildly emphysematous lung
tissue. We also defined a number of genes whose expression levels correlated
strongly with lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide and/or forced
expiratory volume at 1 s. Genes related to oxidative stress, extracellular matrix
synthesis, and inflammation were increased in severe emphysema, whereas
expression of endothelium-related genes was decreased. To identify candidate
genes that might be causally involved in the pathogenesis of emphysema, we linked
gene expression profiles to chromosomal regions previously associated with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in genome-wide linkage analyses.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the LVRS samples revealed distinct
molecular subclasses of severe emphysema, with body mass index as the only
clinical variable that differed between the groups. Class prediction models
established a set of genes that predicted functional outcome at 6 mo after LVRS. 
Our findings suggest that the gene expression profiles from human emphysematous
lung tissue may provide insight into pathogenesis, uncover novel molecular
subclasses of disease, predict response to LVRS, and identify targets for
therapeutic intervention.

The inflammatory chemokines interleukin-8, macrophage inflammatory
protein-1alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, are reportedly involved
in the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although
bronchiolar epithelial cells and macrophages are known to be the cellular
sources, the relative contribution of each cell type remains to be elucidated. In
the present study, we first quantified cytokine mRNA in human bronchiolar
epithelial cells and macrophages obtained using laser-capture microdissection and
explored the relationship with early-stage COPD. Only in bronchiolar epithelial
cells were interleukin-8, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA levels higher in smokers with airflow limitation
and/or emphysema than those in never-smokers or smokers without either airflow
limitation or emphysema. No difference was observed in macrophages. Complementary
DNA (cDNA) array further revealed the overexpression of CC chemokine receptor 2
in bronchiolar epithelial cells from smokers with airflow limitation and/or
emphysema. This study supports the role of bronchiolar epithelium as the source
of increased inflammatory chemokine levels in the early development of COPD and
also demonstrates the potential use of laser-capture microdissection, combined
with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and cDNA microarrays, to
investigate functional profiles of individual structural and inflammatory cells
in human lungs.

An increasing body of evidence indicates that the bronchial epithelium plays a
crucial role in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). The aim of this study was to identify new genes whose bronchoepithelial
expression is specifically altered in COPD patients. Primary bronchial epithelial
cell (PBEC) cultures were established from exsmokers with stable airflow
limitation and never smokers. Complementary deoxyribonucleic acid array
technology was used to investigate the differential expression of 847 cytokine
and cytokine-related genes between the two groups. Statistical analysis was
performed by means of significance analysis of microarrays and
Bonferroni-corrected analysis of variance on ranks. Discriminant analysis and
light cycler measurements as well as flow cytometry and Western blotting were
used to confirm the significance of the array results at both the messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein expression levels. With respect to array
experiments, melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM) was identified as the sole
gene showing highly significant upregulation in PBECs from COPD patients compared
to never smokers. Light cycler measurements confirmed these results, revealing a 
2.9-fold and 2.0-fold increase in MCAM mRNA expression in COPD patients compared 
to nonsmokers and smokers, respectively. In addition, these differences are
associated with higher median protein expression levels. These results strongly
suggest involvement of melanoma cell adhesion molecule in the pathophysiology of 
the chronic airway inflammation seen in patients with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease.
